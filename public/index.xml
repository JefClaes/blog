      <description>Somewhere around a year ago, we started using GES in production as the primary data store of our new loyalty system. The system stores two types of data.
 External services push batches of dumb downed events to the loyalty system. For example: a user logged on, played a game or participated in a competition. These events are transient by nature. Once the loyalty system has processed them, they only need to be kept around for a few days.</description>

      <description>Late 2017, we set out to replace and upgrade our existing reporting and analytics infrastructure with something that would be a better fit for our workloads. Keeping costs and required maintenance at a minimum would be a nice plus, making for an easy sell. After a bit of research, it was obvious Amazon Redshift had the potential to tick all the right boxes. While steadily porting the most problematic workloads away from our existing infrastructure, I started writing an investigative article on the fundamental concepts of Amazon Redshift.</description>

      <description>Another year, another 17 books, 6 shows and 3 movies consumed. Here&amp;rsquo;s this year&amp;rsquo;s highlights.
Books The Zen and Art of Motor Cycle Maintenance The author is a tormented soul on a quest to define quality. You&amp;rsquo;re his passenger, driving shot gun on a CB77 Super Hawk, in for an exhausting intellectual journey through the high mountains of reasoning. You will often fear getting lost and feel slightly anxious that the driver might drive of a cliff any moment, but he won&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Before last week, the only certification exam I ever passed was the Microsoft .NET Framework Application Development Foundation certification. This was almost eight years ago. My manager back then thought getting certified was the best way for me to get a raise. It would be a win-win. I for one would learn something along the way, and the company would have less trouble keeping its Microsoft Gold partnership. As far as I remember, I spent a good six months reading, studying and memorizing this 794 pages thick book.</description>

      <description>Most EventStore client libraries allow you to subscribe to a stream by passing in a callback which is invoked when an event occurs (either a live or historic event).
type Envelope = { Id : Int64 Event : Event Historic : bool } type EventOccurred = Envelope -&amp;gt; unit Let&amp;rsquo;s say we subscribe to a stream of a popular video service, and we want to project a read model that shows how many videos a viewer has watched.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to share this experience for a while, but it took me a while to come up with a story and example I could use in a blog post.
I help out during the weekends in a small family run magic shop. I&amp;rsquo;m the third generation working in the shop. My great-grandfather always hoped that his only son would follow in his footsteps as a carpenter. But at only eighteen years old, my grandfather said goodbye to the chisels and sawdust, and set out for the big city to chase his dream of becoming a world class magician.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve organized a few DDDBE meetups in the past, and always succeed in forgetting something. Either someone points it out well in advance, or I end up stressing last minute. This post partly serves as a checklist for myself, but it would be a welcome side effect to also see it encourage others to help out organizing future meetups. Organizing a meetup is not rocket science, having a list of what to take care of is a good start.</description>

      <description>At work, we&amp;rsquo;ve all grown quite vigilant when it comes to customers trying to cheat the system. A necessary trait when working in a domain where money flows back and forth and customers are always trying to find an edge that will turn the tables.
While most tend to leave this mindset at work, one colleague in particular, is always probing, trying to find cracks in the surface of everyday models.</description>

      <description>When people get paid to write software, we very often find some form of friction between the people that build the software and those that pay to have it built.
The company I joined three years ago was no exception. When I joined, they had just launched three months ago, weren&amp;rsquo;t seeing any return on investment and prospects weren&amp;rsquo;t too bright either.
I won&amp;rsquo;t lie, that first year was quite stressful.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m keeping the tradition alive, sharing how much I&amp;rsquo;ve consumed over the last year highlighting the things that stood out. 18 books, 8 movies and 9 shows. Looks like I consumed more than other years, which probably also explains why I produced less after-hours.
Books I finished the Dark Tower series after 3 years. Following Roland Deschain and his ka-tet throughout the 8 books has been an epic adventure. Finishing Harry Potter by the time I was 18, I had little hopes to be ever dragged into such a long and captivating tale ever again.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into handing a bit of our messaging infrastructure over to a managed alternative. Managing your own messaging infrastructure that should be highly available is not always an investment you want to make in this day and age. Going through the documentation and relying on experiences from some people I trust, I ended up looking at AWS and SNS/SQS.
Making the Github repository rounds, looking for inspiration, I stumbled on JustSaying: a library by the people from JustEat implementing a message bus on top of AWS.</description>

      <description>Seems that it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to beat the Gaussian curve of blogging frequency. On the other hand, I spent quite some of my mental blogging budget on an interview with InfoQ.
I&amp;rsquo;m a bit bummed out that it&amp;rsquo;s such a large wall of text. When submitting the answers, I highlighted some snippets which should make for easier scanning. Too bad the formatting was lost when publishing it. I included some highlights below.</description>

      <description>Writing doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always come naturally to me. It often takes me days, weeks or even months of toying with an idea, before I think it&amp;rsquo;s mature enough to put it down into writing. I can&amp;rsquo;t afford that luxury this time though, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think of myself as much of a friend if Pieter didn&amp;rsquo;t get to read this in time.
I met Pieter the first time in a bar in Vilnius, December 2013, I accidentally ended up sitting next to him during the traditional pre-conf drinks.</description>

      <description>In the oldest system I&amp;rsquo;m maintaining right now, we have an account aggregate that, next to mutating various balances, produces immutable financial transactions. These transactions are persisted together with the aggregate itself to a relational database. The transactions can be queried by the owner of the account in an immediate consistent fashion.
The table with these transactions looks similar to this:
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Transaction] ( [Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, [Timestamp] [datetime] NULL, [AccountId] [int] NOT NULL, [TransactionType] [varchar](25) NOT NULL, [CashAmount] [decimal](19, 2) NOT NULL, [BonusAmount] [decimal](19, 2) NOT NULL, [.</description>

      <description>User notifications are a feature that came as an afterthought, but turned out to be rather easy to implement - without touching (read: breaking) existing functionality - thanks to having an immutable event log.
In the domain I&amp;rsquo;m working in at the moment, we will often give users incentives to return to the website, or to extend their stay on the website. These incentives were only communicated by email at first, and this is a decent medium when you want users to return to the website.</description>

      <description>Visualizing some data earlier this week I had to compute the running total of a sequence of numbers.
For example, if the input sequence was [ 100; 50; 25 ] the result of the computation would be a new sequence of [ 100; 150; 175 ].
Muscle memory made me take a procedural approach, which works, but made me wonder if I could get away with less lines of code and without mutable state.</description>

      <description>I started in 2014 to keep lists of everything I consume. I&amp;rsquo;ve continued this effort throughout 2015 and can now share the items I particularly enjoyed.
In 2015, I read 16 books and 3 papers, watched 3 movies and 4 shows, listened to 1 audio book and no podcasts. A lot less TV compared to 2014, but most of that time went to playing video games with some of my friends.</description>

      <description>In my recent talk on Evil by Design, I showed how I&amp;rsquo;ve been visualizing event streams as a means to get a better grip on how aggregates behave in production. The talk&amp;rsquo;s scope kept me from showing the code that goes together with the examples shown. Consider this post as an addendum to that talk.
First off, we need a few types: a string that identifies a stream, an event containing a timestamp and its name.</description>

The talk should have been recorded, but you can already find the abstract and slides below.
 Last year I ventured into the domain of (online) gambling. Given that the industry has been around since forever, I expected most problems to be of the technical kind.</description>

      <description>Casinos invest a lot of energy selling the dream. One way to do this is by showing off people winning big in your casino. Everyone has seen those corny pictures of people holding human-sized cheques right? It&amp;rsquo;s a solid tactic, since empirical evidence shows that after a store has sold a large-prize winning lottery ticket, the ticket sales increase from 12 to 38% over the following weeks.
If we look at slot machine play, what exactly defines a big win?</description>

      <description>Early Summer, I had to set up an integration with an external partner. They required of us to daily provide them with a relational dataset stored in SQL Server. Most, if not all of the data was temporal, append-only by nature; think logins, financial transactions..
Since the data required largely lived in an eventstore on our end, I needed fast bulk projections. Having experimented with a few approaches, I eventually settled on projections in F# taking advantage of type providers.</description>

This is one of those problems where I don&amp;rsquo;t even mind breaking my head over, but directly head over to Stackoverflow to find an accepted answer which I can just copy paste. Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t find an F# snippet I could use, I ported some JavaScript, and embedded the result below for future snippet hunters.</description>

      <description>In a previous series of posts, I went over the models used by casinos to spin a wheel (spinning, manipulating the odds, clustering and near misses). I did not yet expand on the basic mathematical models that ensure a casino makes money.
Let&amp;rsquo;s pretend we are spinning the wheel again. The wheel has 5 pockets, and just one of those is the winning one. Given we will be using an unmodified wheel, you win 1 out of 5 spins.</description>

      <description>This is the third post in my series on porting a node.js application to an F# application.
So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at parsing command line arguments, handling commands and storing events. Today, I want to project those events into something useful that can be formatted and printed to the console.
In the original application, I only had a single query. The result of this query lists all items consumed grouped by category, sorted chronologically.</description>

      <description>As I wrote earlier, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on porting a node.js web application to an F# console application. It&amp;rsquo;s an application I wrote to learn node.js but still use today to keep track of all the things I consume.
The application is able to consume an item, to remove a consumed item and to query all consumed items.
In the previous post, I parsed command line arguments into typed commands and queries.</description>

      <description>Coming from C#, I&amp;rsquo;m used to the compiler warning me about unused variables. Relying on the compiler to help me with checked exceptions in F#, I noticed that unused values (and functions) would go unnoticed. Having accidentally read earlier that Haskell has a compiler flag to check for unused bindings, I looked for the F# equivalent but failed to find it, until Scott Wlaschin pointed me in the right direction.</description>

I had something working pretty quickly, deployed it to Heroku and still find myself using it today. Since there&amp;rsquo;s very little use for having it running on a server, and because I wanted something to toy with getting better at F#, I decided to port it to an F# console application.</description>

      <description>In the land of C#, exceptions are king. By definition exceptions help us deal with &amp;ldquo;unexpected or exceptional situations that arise while a program is running&amp;rdquo;. In that regard, we&amp;rsquo;re often optimistic, overoptimistic. Most code bases treat errors as exceptional while they&amp;rsquo;re often commonplace. We are so confident about the likelyhood of things going wrong, we don&amp;rsquo;t even feel the need to communicate to consumers what might go wrong. If a consumer of a method wants to know what exceptions might be thrown, he needs to resort to reading the documentation (or source) and hope it&amp;rsquo;s up-to-date.</description>

      <description>In our system a backoffice user can issue a promotion code for users to redeem. Redeeming a promotion code, a user receives a discount on his next purchase or a free gift. A promotion code is only active for a limited amount of time, can only be redeemed a limited amount of times and can only be redeemed once per user.

      <description>Since online gambling has been regulated in Belgium, basically each eligible license holder has complemented their land based operations with an online counterpart. Being such a small country, everyone wants to secure their market share as soon as possible. The big players have been pouring tons of money in to marketing and advertising, it&amp;rsquo;s everywhere: radio, television, (online) newspapers, bus stops, billboards, sport events, airplane vouchers - you name it. While regulations for land based casinos are very strict and almost overprotective, regulations for online play are much more permissive.</description>

      <description>This week marked my first year at my current employer. While that event went by rather silently, one year in, a few of my observations are finally shaping up to be cast into writing.
Where I used to work in the typical battery cage, I&amp;rsquo;m now part of a team of just four people, having the luxury of a big dedicated room to ourselves - a whole floor actually. The room is set up almost symmetrically; two desks on one side of the room and two more on the other side, with quite some space in between.</description>

let responseTimes = [ 18.0; 21.0; 41.0; 42.0; 48.0; 50.0; 55.0; 90.0; ] People like having a single number to summarize a piece of data. The average is the most popular candidate. The average is calculated by dividing the sum of the input elements by the number of input elements.

      <description>Starting 2014, I wanted to look more closely at everything I consume. So I started keeping a list of everything I read, watch and listen to.
I started off with a markdown file on Github that quikcly evolved into a good excuse to dabble with an alternative stack. I ended up writing an event sourced node.js application on top of postgres, hosted on Heroku. I could write a post on that particular experience, but it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say this blog post captures it better than I ever could.</description>

      <description>The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi popularized the term &amp;ldquo;flow&amp;rdquo; to describe states of absorption in which attention is so narrowly focused on an activity that a sense of time fades, along with the troubles and concerns of day-to-day life. &amp;ldquo;Flow provides an escape from the chaos of the quotidian,&amp;rdquo; he wrote.  This is a snippet from the highly recommended book Addiction by Design, which not only gives you an incredibly complete overview of the gambling industry, but also insights into the human psyche which apply far outside the domain of gambling.</description>

      <description>The previous post showed a simple model casinos use to manipulate the odds. Instead of relying on the physical wheel for randomness, they rely on a virtual list of indexes that maps to the physical wheel.
Using that same model, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to fiddle with the virtual indexes so that they map to misses right next to the winning pocket, creating &amp;ldquo;near misses&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Near misses&amp;rdquo; make players feel less like losing, since you &amp;ldquo;almost won&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The previous post defined a basic set of data structures and functions to spin a wheel of fortune in F#.
There was very little mystery to that implementation though. The physical wheel had four pockets and spinning the wheel would land you a win one out of four spins. As a casino, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to come up with an interesting payout using this model.
To juice up the pot, casinos started adding more pockets to the wheel of fortune.</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll define a basic set of data structures and functions to spin a wheel of fortune. In the next post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you the simple model casinos use to build a bigger, more attractive pot, without touching the physical wheel and without losing money. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how casinos tweak that model to bend the odds and create near misses.

Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a physical wheel with four pockets, which are labeled either miss or win.</description>

      <description>Last week, I wrote about splitting a hot aggregate. Discovering that specific hot aggregate was easy; it would cause transactional failures from time to time.
Long-lived hot aggregates often are an indication of a missing concept and an opportunity for teasing things apart. Last week, I took one long-lived hot aggregate and pulled smaller short-lived hot aggregates out, identifying two missing concepts.
Hunting for more hot aggregates, I could visualize event streams and use my eyes to detect bursts of activity, or I could have a little function analyze the event streams for me.</description>

      <description>When you visit a real casino, the constant busy-ness is overwhelming; players spamming buttons, pulling levers, spinning the wheel, gambling on the outcome of sports games, playing cards, feeding the machine, cashing out, breaking bills, ordering drinks or even buying a souvenir. A single player will easily generate a thousand transactions in one sitting.
When you look at an online casino, this isn&amp;rsquo;t very different. In the system we inherited, the biggest and busiest aggregate by far is a user&amp;rsquo;s account.</description>

An empty database file was included into the project. When running the setup, this file would replace the existing test database.</description>

This question is interesting for a couple of reasons. First, it&amp;rsquo;s a shorter FizzBuzz; can the candidate open an IDE, write a few lines of code, compile and run them? And second, does he know what recursion is?
Now let&amp;rsquo;s say, the interviewee knows how to write code and is familiar with the concept of recursion.</description>

Using the Event Store, I tried to read all events of a specific event type. This stream turned out to be a tad too large to be sent over the wire in one piece, leading to a PackageFramingException: Package size is out of bounds.</description>

France offered us the typical vineyards and chateaux. What, next to the good company, will stick with me the most is the High Alpine road in Austria. We paid 34 euros to be allowed on the road, but the surroundings of that piece of asphalt are extraordinary.</description>

      <description>Leaving Plitvice behind us, we crossed the country heading for the sea. We didn&amp;rsquo;t need to cover a lot of distance, to discover how diverse the Croatian landscape and climate is. In only two hours we went from the cold, foggy lakes and waterfalls to green meadows to dusty mountains to sunbathing coasts.


We followed the coastline for a little while, strolling through old coast towns, eating seafood, drinking something cold.</description>

They had once been assigned to the same team, but because of the constant bickering, which had put a serious amount of stress on the team, one of them was pulled off the project and reassigned.
A good year later, just the two of them were assigned to a new smallish, but interesting in-house project.</description>

      <description>The .NET framework mainly provides two models for asynchronous programming: (1) the Asynchronous Programming Model (APM), that uses callbacks, and (2) the Task Asynchronous Pattern (TAP), that uses Tasks, which are similar to the concept of futures.
The Task represents the operation in progress, and its future result. The Task can be (1) queried for the status of the operation, (2) synchronized upon to wait for the result of the operation, or (3) set up with a continuation that resumes in the background when the task completes.</description>

      <description>San Francisco, 1852. With the California Gold Rush at its peak, successful gold-seekers wanted to protect all their precious gold nuggets by storing them in a strong safe. At the time, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that easy to have access to a safe though. At the very beginning, it were just a few local merchants that owned one. Not much later, bankers swamped the area hoping to get their piece of the pie - bringing the strongest safes money can buy.</description>

Two minutes before the workshop we found a domain expert prepared to talk about his coupon start-up.</description>

Being such a young conference, I had no idea what to expect. Turns out they have a good thing going on; a small, local and very personal approach to conferences. Speakers both local and international, covering topics that serve the community, not their employer.
Together with Tom, I preached Alberto&amp;lsquo;s Event Storming during a four hour long workshop.</description>

Although we could use any Windows client framework, we like building things in the browser better for a number of reasons; platform-independence, familiar user experience, JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous programming model and its incredible rich ecosystem.</description>

      <description>As you might have noticed reading my last two posts, I have been doing a bit of front-end work using knockout.js. Here is something that had me scratching my head for a little while..
In one of our pages we&amp;rsquo;re subscribing to a specific event. As soon as that event arrives, we need to reinitialize the model that is bound to our container element. Going through snippets earlier, I remembered seeing the cleanNode function being used a few times - which I thought would remove all knockout data and event handlers from an element.</description>

      <description>While I got to use angular.js for a good while last year, I found myself returning to knockout.js for the current application I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Where angular.js is a heavy, intrusive, opinionated, but also very complete framework, knockout.js is a small and lightweight library giving you not much more than a dynamic model binder. So instead of blindly following the angular-way, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to introduce my own set of abstractions and plumbing again; I assume that I&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a lot less.</description>

      <description>Last week, we added a dashboard to our back office application that shows some actionable data about what&amp;rsquo;s going on in our system. Although we have infrastructure in place to push changes to the browser, it seemed more reasonable to have the browser fetch fresh data every few minutes.
We split the dashboard up in a few functional cohesive widgets. On the server, we built a view-optimized read model for each widget.</description>

      <description>In the last project I worked on - processing financial batches - we put a lot of effort in avoiding being silently wrong. The practice that contributed most was being religious about avoiding structures to ever be in an invalid state. Preconditions, invariants, value objects and immutability were key.
One of the things we had to do with these structures was writing them to disk in a specific banking format; all the accounts with their transactions for a specific day.</description>

      <description>Almost four years ago Udi Dahan introduced an elegant technique that allows you to have your domain model dispatch events without injecting a dispatcher into the model - keeping your model focused on the business at hand.
This works by having a static DomainEvents class which dispatches raised events.
This customer aggregate raises an event when a customer moves to a new address.
public class Customer { private readonly string _id; private Address _address; private Name _name; public Customer(string id, Name name, Address address) { Guard.</description>

      <description>There are two big parts to Domain Driven Design; strategy and tactics. Strategy helps setting out a high-level grand design, while tactics enable us to execute on the strategy.
Practicing strategic design, we generally first try to list all of the different parts that make our business a whole; these are sub-domains. When you look at a supermarket chain, you would find sub-domains like real estate management, advertising, suppliers, stock, sales, human resources, finance, security and so on.</description>

      <description>Monday, I and four others did a DDDBE session on the strategic side of Domain Driven Design.
My talk covered the Ubiquitous Language, and can be found on Slideshare. I might end up writing down the content of the talk as well - some images are meaningless without words. Evaluating feedback, I think the biggest mistake we made was keeping some things too abstract - curse of knowledge at work. If we get the chance to repeat the session, we need to make sure to weave a practical story through our talks to make them stick.</description>

      <description>Over Christmas break, I set out three days to play with the EventStore. One of the things I wanted to do was visualize the timeline of a stream in the browser. Since the EventStore exposes its event streams over atom in JSON, I could directly consume them from JavaScript.
An event stream can contain quite a few events. Since caching parts of that stream benefits all components in the system, the atom feed is split in multiple pages - where all full pages are cacheable.</description>

      <description>We are surrounded by systems day in, day out. As software developers, we even get to spend a big portion of our day actively building and changing systems - be it software, teams, communities or businesses. Seeing the whole, but more importantly understanding how systems exist of inter-related parts that affect each other in all kinds of interesting ways, is crucial to growing sustainable systems.
Thinking in Systems is a primer on the subject of system thinking written by Donella H.</description>

      <description>In essence, repositories are a simple abstraction over aggregate storage. A repository will insert, update, delete or fetch an aggregate from the underlying persistence mechanism. This abstraction avoids that databases, SQL statements, Object Mappers and the like leak into your domain. Next to that, swapping out repositories for an in-memory version makes testing easier.
Recently, the use of repositories is being questioned again.
Why would we wrap Object Mappers in yet another abstraction?</description>

I use this annual post to look back at the year passed, and to look ahead to the year to come. I gave up on making resolutions in 2011. This year, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be naively ambitious again going into 2014.
Compared to previous years, I feel more confident that I have a pretty good idea of what I want next.</description>

Both salesmen reported home within days of their arrival. The first salesman wrote: &amp;ldquo;This trip turned out to be a waste of time; the locals are not wearing any shoes.&amp;rdquo; The second salesman wrote something similar, yet very different: &amp;ldquo;This is looking very promising; people aren&amp;rsquo;t wearing any shoes yet!&amp;rdquo;</description>

In the post he goes over a pain point he has often found himself struggling with while breaking down a large method; conditional statements. if (alarmEnabled) { var alarm = new Alarm(); ... alarm.Sound(); } Should we extract the if and the associated block into a new method, or just the content of the block? Is the condition too important to hide in a method?</description>

This post is no exception (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012).Today was probably the first time this year that I took some time to study my blog&amp;rsquo;s Google Analytics metrics. If I keep last year&amp;rsquo;s black swan posts out of the equation, traffic seems to be comparable to last year&amp;rsquo;s. The most meaningful metrics to me are the number of subscriptions and the average time spent reading.</description>

In the first project I worked on just out of school, we weren&amp;rsquo;t doing anything interesting with databases; we didn&amp;rsquo;t have that many users, or that much data.</description>

After a few long months, I was looking forward to be influenced and inspired by concepts and experiences strange to my day-to-day job - surrounded by people hungry to build better software. Because of the diversity of the program, the high level of the speakers and the presence of some familiar DDD-community faces, my expectations were easily met. Also, the location and low rates for tickets, transport and beer make it a very reasonable investment.</description>

      <description>When things are fragile, they break easily. We often see fragility as a bad thing and design things to be robust. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t what we&amp;rsquo;re really after either; things that are robust might be hard to break, but they&amp;rsquo;re also hard to change, making them fail to adapt to new stressors over time. The model that we&amp;rsquo;re really after is antifragility; when something is antifragile it will benefit from stressors and get better over time.</description>

      <description>I heard a story once about an engineer who worked on the Disneyland site when it opened in Anaheim, CA in 1955. A month before the park opened, the new grass and sod were being applied to the grounds as one of the last items to be completed before the big grand opening. The parking lot was some distance from the park&amp;rsquo;s gates and required a lot of turf. However, the sidewalks had not been planned or constructed to accommodate patterns.</description>

After a short introduction on event storming participants were initiated to the domain of Cambio CarSharing - which is packed with behaviour. After that, seven groups of five (+ one domain expert) spread out across the office, and spent two slots of twenty minutes modeling the domain - with two extra slots for feedback.</description>

      <description>Like I mentioned last week - after only five posts on the subject - there still are a great deal of event sourcing nuances left to be discovered.
My current event store implementation only supports a single user. Due to an aggressive file lock, concurrently accessing an aggregate will throw an exception. Can we allow multiple users to write to and read from an event stream? Also, what can we do about users making changes to the same aggregate; can we somehow detect conflicts and avoid changes to be committed?</description>

      <description>Having covered projections last week, I think I have come full circle in these posts that turned out to be a small preliminary series on event sourcing. Even though there are still a vast amount of nuances to discover, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve captured the gist of it. Even without running an event sourced system in production - I feel as if I somewhat have an idea of what event sourcing can bring to the table.</description>

      <description>In my first two posts on event sourcing, I implemented an event sourced aggregate from scratch. After being able to have an aggregate record and play events, I looked at persisting them in an event store. Logically, the next question is: how do I query my aggregates, how do I get my state out?
In traditional systems, write and read models are not separated, they are one and the same. Event sourced systems on the other hand have a write model - event streams, and a separate read model.</description>

      <description>Last week, I implemented an event sourced aggregate from scratch. There I learned, that there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to a naively implemented event sourced aggregate; it should be able to initialize itself from a stream of events, and it should be able to record all the events it raises.
public interface IEventSourcedAggregate : IAggregate { void Initialize(EventStream eventStream); EventStream RecordedEvents(); } The question I want to answer today is: how do I persist those event sourced aggregates?</description>

      <description>Last week I shared my theoretical understanding of event sourcing. Today, I want to make an attempt at making that theory tangible by implementing an event sourced aggregate.
In traditional systems, we only persist the current state of an object.

In event sourced systems, we don&amp;rsquo;t persist the current state of an object, but the sequence of events that caused the object to be in the current state.</description>

This time, we were invited by friends to accompany them in staying over at their family&amp;rsquo;s house - who made it their job to lead guided tours through Prague.
We left Thursday right after work, hoping to get there in eight hours. A decent traffic jam, a missed exit, and some bad map reading decided otherwise; it added three hours to the trip.</description>

      <description>In an Actor system, each Actor acts as a self-contained and autonomous component. An Actor can only communicate with other Actors by exchanging messages - they are not allowed to share state. Messages are handled asynchronously, and are nondeterministic. The location of Actors should be transparent; they can either live on the same machine, or on a distributed system. These properties make the Actor Model a great fit for parallel and distributed computing.</description>

This format made it possible for everyone to speak, but also forced the speaker to keep the scope of the talk focused, and to organize the information in a way that attendees can get the gist of it in only twelve minutes.</description>

Sure, we met up regularly for CQRS beers, but we felt that we could do more, better. That&amp;rsquo;s when we coined the term modellathon, something like a hackathon, but instead of writing code, we would build models.
Thanks to the effort of Mathias, Stijn and Yves, Tuesday marked the first get-together of the Belgian DDD user group in its official form.</description>

      <description>These last few days, I have been working on a piece of our codebase that accidentally got very inheritance heavy.
When it comes to inheritance versus composition, there are a few widely accepted rules of thumb out there. While prefer composition over inheritance doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover the nuances, it&amp;rsquo;s not terrible advice; composition will statistically often be the better solution. Steve McConnell&amp;rsquo;s composition defines a &amp;lsquo;has a&amp;rsquo;- relationship while inheritance defines an &amp;lsquo;is a&amp;rsquo;-relationship, gives you a more nuanced and simple tool to apply to a scenario.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, we set out to implement a feature that enabled back office users to set a new rate ahead of time. With our analyst and the involved user being out of the office for days, we had to solely rely on written requirements. Two of us skimmed the documents, but didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to assure there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any ambiguity - it looked trivial really. I went back to what I was doing, while my colleague set out to implement this feature.</description>

      <description>Working on side projects, I often find myself using RavenDB for storage and IronMQ for queueing. I wrote about that last one before here and here.
One project I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now makes use of domain events. As an example, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the usual suspect: the BookingConfirmed event. When a booking has been confirmed, I want to notify my customer by sending him an email.
I want to avoid that persisting a booking fails because an eventhandler throws - the mail server is unavailable.</description>

      <description>A good while ago, I blogged on commands (and queries). After exploring various flavors, I eventually settled on this one; commands, handlers and an in-memory bus that serves as a command executor.
Commands help you in supporting the ubiquitous language by explicitly capturing user intent at the boundaries of your system - think use cases. You can look at them as messages that are being sent to your domain. In this regard, they also serve as a layer over your domain - decoupling the inside from the outside, allowing you to gradually introduce concepts on the inside, without breaking the outside.</description>

      <description>After seventeen days, 2000 miles (3220km), seven states, eight national parks and fifteen motels, our second USA road trip has come to an end. Inspired, and with new insights, we&amp;rsquo;re leaving for Belgium in the morning.
Along the way, we documented our journey in these posts:

      <description>We didn’t get to see a lot of Salt Lake City. Before heading to Idaho Falls, we hung around at the mall, feasted on Sushi, and bought new hiking shoes since ours literally fell apart.
Since Idaho Falls just served as a launching point to Yellowstone, we filled the hole in our schedule with a date night; we had BBQ and went to see WorldWar Z.
After another long drive the next day, we exchanged the dirt for greener scenery.</description>

      <description>We’re past halfway our trip and we need to make headway if we want to stay on schedule and reach Yellowstone by Sunday. Long, but pleasant drives; if you’re used to Belgian traffic.
Yesterday we visited Capitol Reef National Park. We originally planned on doing the Hickman Bridge Trail, but apparently there had recently been a big rock fall, blocking access at the trailhead. As an alternative we did the Narrows trail at Grand Wash Road, which was carved by a stream ages ago and is now still sometimes victim to flashfloods.</description>

      <description>These last two days have been rather tiring. Yesterday we drove up to Bryce Canyon, where we did the Queen’s Garden and Navajo Loop hike, which was only 3 miles (5km) but was rather strenuous because the trail takes you all the way down and all the way up again.


Today we followed the advice of the kind lady at the visitor center and hiked along Calfs Creek. It was a 6 miles (10km) round trip through loose sand in over 100°F (38°C), but halfway you’re rewarded with a stunningly beautiful waterfall and a refreshing dip in the basin.</description>

      <description>Since our stay in Vegas was rather short, we selected some things we failed to do last time. For me, shooting a gun was definitely on that list. Although I&amp;rsquo;m not that big on gun culture - seems to me that if you live by the gun, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to die by the gun - it&amp;rsquo;s still a thrill holding such a powerful weapon. We headed to Vegas&amp;rsquo;s most popular shooting range: The Gun Store.</description>

      <description>After a strenuous drive from Los Angeles to San Diego, we took advantage of the mild climate to unwind at San Diego’s Aquatica.
Being the 4thof July, we joined the festivities and watched the fireworks from the car. Sadly we didn’t get to see a redo of last year’s spectacle, when San Diego accidentally launched all its fireworks in 30 seconds.

Next we headed for Joshua Tree National Park. With temperatures flirting with 100°F (38°C), we took on one small hike and drove up to two viewpoints; Skull Rock and Key’s View.</description>

We left Antwerp Sunday 7AM to touch down 25 hours later in LAX, after an eight hour cross-Atlantic flight to Newark and a six hour overlay waiting for a connecting flight.
We were welcomed by a rental car salesman who strongly advised us to upgrade to a bigger SUV which would give us tinted windows since it’s gonna be hot, you know.</description>

      <description>Hanging around in the pub after DDDX, I ended up talking to Alberto Brandolini. For those who have never met him; he&amp;rsquo;s very much into visualization. You will always see him carrying a drawing pad, with a dash of permanent marker on his cheek, and a few lost sticky notes on his back. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was the Italian accent and the strong gestures, or my mildly intoxicated condition, but the idea of visualization as an important tool grew on me even more that evening.</description>

      <description>Older Internet Explorer versions are notorious for agressively caching AJAX requests. In this post, you&amp;rsquo;ll find two techniques that combat this behaviour.
The first option is to have your server explicitly set the caching headers.
Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1)); Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(false); Response.Cache.SetRevalidation(HttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); Since you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily own the server, or clients might already have cached some requests, you can trick the browser into thinking each request is a fresh one by making each url unique.</description>

      <description>This post is a follow-up to my previous blog post &amp;ldquo;Accidental entities - you don&amp;rsquo;t need that identity&amp;quot;.
In that post, we followed a consultant building an application for a car rental. One of the requirements was that the CEO could manage a collection of available colors. Although the tools at our disposal - a relational database and NHibernate - wanted to trick us into making a car reference one of these available colors by its identifier, we found out that the CEO really thinks of a car&amp;rsquo;s color as a value, and does not care about a color&amp;rsquo;s identity.</description>

      <description>An entity is identified by an identifier, while value objects are identified by their value.
If I make a living renting cars to tourists, I might not care the least about the identity of the colors the cars came in. I just care about their value; Rosso Corsa, Azurro Metallic&amp;hellip; If I repaint the car, the color changes, and the previous color is abandoned as a whole.
However, if I were a car paint manufacturer, I would care a great deal about the identity of a color.</description>

      <description>When you use knockout validation to extend observables with validation rules, it will add a few functions to these observables - the most important ones being; error and isValid. You can use these functions to verify if any of the validation rules were violated, and to extract an error message.
To extract all of the error messages out of a composite model, you can use a grouping function.

A better model  Even if you come up with a better model, the fact that it has been the ubiquitous language of the domain for decades proves that it works for them.

      <description>Two weeks ago I got to spend four days attending the IDDD Tour by Vaughn Vernon. Although my book queue has only allowed me to shallowly browse the book, I had high hopes for this course. I anticipated a week of getting lectured on DDD with a few practical exercises, but was blown away by the openness and interaction promoted by Vaughn and his associate Alberto Brandolini. A passionate group, engaging workshops, long days and lots of sharing made these few days exceptionally satisfying and inspirational.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work lately which involves sequentially reading large files (&amp;gt; 2 to 5GB). This entails that it&amp;rsquo;s not an option to read the whole structure in memory; it&amp;rsquo;s more reliable to process the file in chunks. I occasionally come across legacy that solves exactly this problem, but in a procedural way, resulting in tangled spaghetti. To be honest, the first piece of software I ever wrote in a professional setting also went at it in the wrong way.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I shared my first impressions of IronMQ. Last week, I looked at some infrastructure to facilitate pulling from IronMQ. This implementation worked, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t put it under stress yet; &amp;ldquo;First make it work, then make it fast&amp;rdquo;, and all of that.
I arranged a simple scenario for testing: one message type - thus one queue, where there are eight queue consumers that simultaneously pull messages from that queue, and dispatch them to a handler which sleeps for one second.</description>

      <description>I wrote about using IronMQ as a cloud-based message queue last week. In that post I explained that you can go at using IronMQ in two ways; either you pull from the queue yourself, or you let IronMQ push messages from the queue to your HTTP endpoints. At first sight, the latter allows you to outsource more infrastructure to their side, but upon closer inspection it also introduces other concerns: security, local debugging and scalability.</description>

      <description>First time I touched messaging was in the first few years of my professional life working on software that supported fire departments in their day-to-day activities. The dispatching software would send messages to a proprietary broker, which in its turn would forward them to interested subscribers; other dispatching clients, or services. To ensure availability, the broker component could failover to a different machine, but that was about it. It didn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to queue or retry messages; if you weren&amp;rsquo;t up when the messages were forwarded, you would never receive them.</description>

      <description>Somewhere over a year and a half ago I discovered the music of Dire Straits, which has sparked a fanatical love and fascination for the guitar in me, and basically for every piece of music Mark Knopfler has ever touched (*). A year ago, I finally had the courage to pick up the guitar myself. Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;d stick with it, I made an uninformed purchase of a rather inexpensive Squier Jazzmaster, just because it somewhat resembled the real object of desire, a Fender Stratocaster.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing quite a bit about CQS (or command and query separation) lately. In my last post on using events, I already hinted towards bringing in the R; command and query responsibility separation.
With CQS, commands can mutate data, while queries can only read that data. CQRS takes this one step further, and assigns commands and queries each a dedicated model; we now talk of a write side, and a read side.</description>

Over the years that has changed a bit, but with that, I&amp;rsquo;ve also slowly become more judgemental towards peers, often prematurely, and not always deservedly.
The first few months of last year, I found myself doing maintenance on a legacy code base between projects.</description>

      <title>Raising events in commandhandlers</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve explored quite a few options on how to handle commands and queries in the last few posts. I finally settled on this approach. The example used in that post looked like this.
public class CreateSubscriptionCommandHandler : ICommandHandler&amp;lt;CreateSubscriptionCommand&amp;gt; { private IDocumentSession _session; public CreateSubscriptionCommandHandler(IDocumentSession session) { _session = session; } public void Handle(CreateSubscriptionCommand command) { var subscription = new Documents.Subscription( command.Value, command.Category, command.EmailAddress); _session.Store(subscription); } } Now imagine I would want to do some extra stuff after creating the subscription; update the sales statistics, append the email address to a mailing list, send out a confirmation email, etc.</description>

      <description>In the last few posts I settled on an architecture for handling commands and queries. A byproduct of the described approach, is that your codebase quickly racks up plentiful little classes; a class to hold data, and a handler to act on that data, for each use case.
There are a few ways you can go at organizing things.
Everything in one location When there is very little going on in your application, you can just dump everything in one location without getting hurt too much.</description>

      <description>I never stub or mock the database when I&amp;rsquo;m using RavenDB. Generally, I use an embeddable documentstore running in memory, and initialize a new instance on every test. However, I like to run some stress tests against a real instance, and here I found myself wanting to wipe clean the state of previous tests, without having to create a new database (which is rather slow).
First I create the default DocumentsByEntityName index to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s there - it normally gets created when you open the studio for the first time.</description>

      <description>In my first post on this topic, I started out with an attempt to limit abstractions to solely commands and queries. Commands and queries were self-contained and could be invoked by passing them to a context-providing generic handler. The drawback of this approach was that it made constructor dependency injection impossible. In a next post, I separated data from logic, but never got around to writing a dispatcher that associates command data with their handlers.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year again where I take some time to look back on the year passed and peek at the year ahead. This is mostly a post I like to write up for myself, forcing reflection.
The biggest personal changes this year were moving out of my parents&amp;rsquo; place, and my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s decision to study medicine after graduating as a Master of Arts earlier this year. I had no idea how things would turn out once we lived together, but so far we have been doing great.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s entertaining - and shameful too - to see what kept me busy back then, which opinions I held, and which technologies and techniques are still relevant in the meanwhile. Anyways, here it goes.
The most read post this year, with 37.</description>

      <description>I recently watched a talk on Vimeo where Christin Gorman talks about how cookie dough relates to Hibernate; why use the generic, bloated and one-fits-all solution when you can mix together your own yummy cookie dough? We should aspire to be the Gordon Ramsey of software, not the college student who can only cook Ramen noodles. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched or listened to her talk, you should; it&amp;rsquo;s only a few minutes long, and she brings it really well.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back, I spent an intensive day performance tuning parts of a, to me, relatively unfamiliar part of our codebase. Like it often is, the biggest optimizations were to be found in how we work with the database. Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself to be an NHibernate expert; I read this book and have used it on two projects, but in the end I just do my best to avoid doing stupid things with it.</description>

      <description>On my first job interview, over four years ago, I was asked whether I would relocate if I was hired. Back then, I still lived in the Campine region with my parents, while the Ferranti Computer Systems headquarters are in Antwerp. I thought about it for a few seconds and told the interviewer that I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan on moving out of my parents&amp;rsquo; place in the first few years. Besides, the distance isn&amp;rsquo;t that great; it&amp;rsquo;s only 60km (=37 miles) of highway, how bad could it be?</description>

      <description>I attended and spoke at Web.NET Europe in Milan over the weekend. This was only my fourth full day- or more conference (Techdays Belgium, TechEd Berlin and HTML5 WebCamps), but it was undoubtedly the best one so far.
The quality of the sessions was definitely not inferior to those of bigger conferences. I especially enjoyed the talks on SignalR, OAuth and scaling data (I included some of my notes below). The strength of this conference doesn&amp;rsquo;t lie in the exceptional speakers or sessions though, but in its cozy size and the type of attendees it attracts.</description>

There were multiple sessions on ASP.NET Web API today, and I was responsible for delivering the first one of the day. Being first, and to avoid overlap with others, I tried to lay a solid foundation by focusing on the REST and ASP.NET Web API basics: resources, identifiers, representations, verbs and hypermedia.
More people than I expected showed up for my talk; somewhere around 50 to 70 attendees, I guess.</description>

Yesterday I wrote about an architecture which limits abstractions by solely introducing commands and queries. I shared a dead simple variation of this pattern, the advantages I experienced, and how I could still unit test the controller if I wanted to. At the end of that post I wondered how I would be able to test commands in isolation; suppose the implementation doesn&amp;rsquo;t use a database this time, but a hairy, too low-level, third party webservice.</description>

 Self-contained commands with dependencies Separating command data from logic and sending it on a bus  We need abstraction, but the amount of abstraction we really need depends, and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. It seems advisable to grow abstractions, and to introduce them gradually.

Although we only planned this trip a week in advance, we still failed to anticipate how erratic the weather can be in October; setting up camp in the dark, on a sloughy underground, with a soft drizzle on your back, isn&amp;rsquo;t my idea of fun after a long day at work. The next morning, with destination Cape Blanc Nez, we drove over coastal routes between vast green fields, towards clearer skies.</description>

      <description>It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long before I noticed how little job titles mean. In my first job, you were assured to be granted a fancy title after only having acquired a minimum seniority, if you knew how to play the game. A more important sounding job title was HR&amp;rsquo;s default bribe that often kept people from leaving for greener pastures, for a short while. But even after being upgraded from a stable cleaner to a Senior Barn Hygiene Technician, you&amp;rsquo;re still cleaning shit though.</description>

      <description>While most REST concepts are rather easy to grok, there is one concept which I found harder to understand at first: Hypermedia. Let it be that without this concept, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out on an extremely important strength of REST. Hypermedia enables you to build dumb - or smart, depending on your perspective - clients, which are mostly driven by the server. Practically, this is implemented as resources embedding links which allow the client to discover and navigate through your RESTful service.</description>

I gave a 90 minute long crash course on REST and ASP.NET Web API.

      <description>ASP.NET Web API controllers support only four HTTP verbs by convention: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. The full list of existing HTTP verbs is more extensive though. One of those unsupported verbs which can be particularly useful for API discovery and documentation is the OPTIONS verb.
 The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval.</description>

This class contained somewhere around 2700 (non-generated) lines of code, where each method manually converted some object to a simple textual representation.

      <description>With this last post, our trip to Italy has come to an end. We have spent these last few days practicing several indispensable tourist activities: testing the ice cold lake water, to wriggle between other sunbathers on the packed beach right after, exuberant eating and drinking, reading novels, and sauntering between prullaria shops.
Fortuitously, one of our last evenings here was upgraded by fireworks over an already moonlit Lake Garda. This outlying location gave the fireworks show an extra notch.</description>

As it turned out, the hiking trail that was described in the brochures as suitable for all and with a duration of 1h20, in reality took us 2h30 and sour calves to complete. The views of the lake&amp;rsquo;s valley and its school of windsurfers defying the wind were worth the sweat though. Arriving at the endpoint, and discovering that we had to wait over an hour for the bus to take us back, we stumbled upon one of the best hidden lake side terraces we&amp;rsquo;ve seen yet.</description>

Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll give it another try later this week, but then earlier in the day. We continued our journey along the coast, passing past several genuinely picturesque villages.</description>

Torbole is a small village, nestled between the mountains, right at the edge of Lake Garda. While the lakeside view is astonishing, you have to pick the right time to truly experience it. In the daytime, the village is overwhelmed by tourists; miles long rows of cars queue to enter the village, pizzerias and ristorantes on every corner, Germans galore.</description>

      <description>Over the last two weeks, preparing for a talk, I have been doing some research on ASP.NET Web API. After working my way through the API, and the implementation of certain features, I looked at testing.
Similar to ASP.NET MVC, Web API allows you to create relatively small building blocks, which can replace parts of, or be added to an existing default global setup. This makes it possible for us to test each component in isolation: controllers, dependency resolvers, filters, serialization, type formatters, messagehandlers and routing.</description>

      <description>Last week, we had to set up a new ASP.NET MVC web application, using a somewhat customized Twitter Bootstrap build. Because the application has multiple functional contexts, we divided it in multiple parts using areas. Since these areas were a one-to-one mapping with the top-level menu items, we tried abstracting the creation of the menu items, ánd the management of setting the active item, into an HtmlHelper.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say, for this example, that we have six areas: Images, Maps, Play, Search, Video and Blog, and we want to render a list item for each one of them.</description>

      <description>Having worked with several storage paradigms over these last few months - from flatfiles, to NoSQL, to the big enterprisey relational databases -, I have spent plenty of time trying to make sense of all the options out there. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I watched one of the last episodes of The Wire season 3 that I had an epiphany regarding modeling data in document stores. Yes, I know, I tend to take those things home with me.</description>

      <title>Persisting model state when using PRG</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2012/06/persisting-model-state-when-using-prg.html</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on an ASP.NET MVC application in which we frequently apply the Post/Redirect/Get pattern. One of the direct consequences of applying this pattern is that you often want to persist the model state across redirects, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t lose validation errors, or the values of input fields.
To persist the model state across redirects, we can put TempData to work. The sole purpose of TempData is exactly this; persisting state until the next request.</description>

      <description>Like I already said last week, I have been dabbling a bit with NancyFx lately.
This week I took a serious look at testing Nancy modules and Razor views. Due to Nancy&amp;rsquo;s defaults and conventions, it takes a little while to set up Nancy in a test context. Then again, Nancy&amp;rsquo;s granularity makes it simple enough to set up a solid test infrastructure by replacing some of its building blocks.</description>

I wholeheartedly believe in the Agile Manifesto, but somewhere along the way Agile - with a capital A - got somewhat of a bad rep.</description>

      <description>Back when I was working on software for fire departments, we started thinking about reworking a critical piece of our solution: deployment plans. In a fire department domain, deployment plans help to make a suggestion to the dispatcher about which units should be dispatched to a location when an incident is called in. The suggested composition of units depends on a wide range of variables: availability, response time, ranks, type of incident, required tools, &amp;hellip; , even politics.</description>

      <description>I wrote an article titled &amp;lsquo;The open plan fallacy&amp;rsquo; just two weeks ago. Earlier this week a similar article was published by the New York Times. The content of that article wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly extraordinary, but the comments were. I waded through all of them on my daily commute, and it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to find one in favor of open plan offices - people seem to be enraged.
I handpicked some of the most interesting ones.</description>

      <description>While browsing the source code of the ELMAH mongoDB provider, I learned about a special type of collections: capped collections.
From the mongoDB documentation:
 Capped collections are fixed sized collections that have a very high performance auto-FIFO age-out feature (age out is based on insertion order). In addition, capped collections automatically, with high performance, maintain insertion order for the documents in the collection; this is very powerful for certain use cases such as logging.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked in a whole lot of places, somewhere around four, but every single one of them used an open plan to structure their workplace. From what I hear from others, it&amp;rsquo;s the standard.
There are a few things to say about the advantages of an open office layout. They should stimulate communication, create more opportunities for observing and learning from others and be more cost-effective. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid it&amp;rsquo;s the latter which is the biggest driver though.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of noise in the tech community earlier this year about how RSS is supposedly having one foot in the grave. If that would be even remotely true, I hope it dies with its boots on. The herald would be browsers and social networking sites killing or hiding support for RSS. While that may be true, their motives shouldn&amp;rsquo;t rig our opinions.
RSS has never worked out for the regular consumer, not directly anyways.</description>

      <description>After writing a few things on HTML5 offline web applications earlier this year, I got contacted by InfoQ to write an in-detail article on the subject for them. I hesitated at first, because I was afraid that it would feel too much like work, taking the fun out of my writing. Turns out it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like that at all. The guys at infoQ were really relaxed to work with, asking interesting questions and giving useful feedback, without forcing me into a certain direction.</description>

      <description>I have been working on a somewhat legacy codebase which makes use of the Servicelocator pattern. Although I always thought of Dependecy Injection to be the superior pattern, I was pleased to find some Inversion of Control implementation in there. Working with the codebase, I discovered first hand how easily, when used without caution and discipline, the Servicelocator pattern can introduce code rot.
I will walk you through some of the issues I have with the Servicelocator pattern, mostly looking at it from a test perspective.</description>

      <description>I wrote about using the HTML5 application cache earlier, mostly focusing on generating and serving the manifest file using ASP.NET MVC. I also bitched about how not one browser I know of gives an indication of the application cache update progress.
Today I wanted to write something about how you can visualize the application cache update progress yourself.
The applicationCache API has several useful and rather straightforward events we can handle to inform the user of the update progress.</description>

      <description>Because I do most of my research while commuting by train, I often pull entire websites offline using httrack. While browsing the [jQuery Mobile documentation](http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0-rc.1/ locally this morning, I stumbled upon following gem.

I was curious to see how they determine whether a page is browsed locally or not. Looking into the source, I was a bit dissapointed to find nothing but plain common sense. The trick is comparing the protocol of the current location with known local protocols.</description>

      <description>Today I wanted to add some screenshots to a GitHub readme for the sake of documenting. While this wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly hard, I do had to iterate a few times before I got it right.
Hosting the images You could simply add the images to your repository and reference them using the raw url&amp;rsquo;s, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t very efficient. Using this method, every request needs to go through GitHub&amp;rsquo;s application layer. It&amp;rsquo;s far better to make use of GitHub Pages, a feature purely designed to publish web content.</description>

      <description>I have been experimenting with the HTML5 offline application cache some more over the last few days, doing boundary tests in an attempt to learn more about browser behaviour in edge cases.
One of these experiments was testing the cache quota.
Two weeks ago, I blogged about generating and serving an offline application manifest using ASP.NET MVC.
I reused that code to add hundreds of 7MB PDF files to the cache.</description>

      <description>According to Matt from 37signals the line &amp;ldquo;Sent from my iPhone&amp;rdquo; at the bottom of an email means this:
 Let’s be honest. “Sent from my iPhone” really means “I’m not going to bother to proofread and correct this because it would take me an extra 30 seconds.”
 I agree. I too use this line as an excuse to write a terse message and omit proper salutations.
However, I also think these four simple words greatly helped the viral growth of the mobile phone.</description>

      <description>Recently I prototyped a mobile web application using ASP.NET MVC, jQuery Mobile and some HTML5 features. One of the key goals was to find out how far you can push a web &amp;lsquo;application&amp;rsquo; until the browser starts getting in the way. Working disconnected is one of these things that appear to be a major showstopper at first.
However - to my surprise honestly - the HTML5 Offline Web applications API seems to be widely implemented across modern browsers already.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t see any reason why this new feature wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work for ASP.NET MVC3 though. If you open the packages config of an ASP.NET MVC4 beta project, you will find that bundling support lives in the Microsoft.Web.Optimization package.
&amp;lt;package id=&amp;#34;Microsoft.Web.Optimization&amp;#34; version=&amp;#34;1.0.0-beta&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; So we should just be able to install this package for an ASP.</description>

      <description>While your Dependency Injection bootstrappers - being responsible for gluing your application together - are a vital part of your application, they are seldom put under test. I don&amp;rsquo;t see any reason why they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be though. The cost of these tests is negligible, definitely if you compare it to the cost of the often catastrophical outcome of bugs in your bootstrappers.
I encourage you to take a look at the commit history of your DI bootstrappers; I bet they change a lot.</description>

      <description>Last week, several news channels reported on the strongest solar storm since 2005. This news item reminded me of a peculiar support ticket we received one gray Monday morning a few years ago, when I was still writing software for fire departments.
# Ticket 7238 Subject: **AVL broken** Status: New Description 06:22 Vehicles stay mostly stationary on the map, even when we are positive they are en route. Fire departments that have to cover a large area - and are wealthy enough - often use AVL (Automatic Vehicle Location) to track their vehicles and visualize them on a map.</description>

      <description>Something I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed until recently is that Wikipedia tries to use the browser&amp;rsquo;s native SVG support to render certain images. For example, if you search for a high resolution image of your country&amp;rsquo;s flag, you will probably end up viewing an SVG. Wikipedia also offers downloads to the image rendered as a PNG though.
Next to being able to scale to an arbitrary size without suffering data loss, the SVG data format allows images to be far more compact.</description>

Handling unknown actions To give you an example, let&amp;rsquo;s say I have a Home controller with an action named Kitten on it. If there is an incoming route for the Home controller with Kitty (instead of Kitten) as the action name, the controller will not be able to invoke any action method and instead will call the HandleUnknownAction method.</description>

      <title>When should you take performance into consideration?</title>

      <description>Before publishing my previous post on rewriting an if, I knew some people would hate it, because the refactored construct is less performant.
Although I think performance is important, relevant performance improvements are, apart from in tight loops, hardly ever to find in language constructs. To put it more bluntly, they are a waste of time. When translating your thoughts into code, you should aim to make your intentions as clear as possible for the person who comes after you.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I came across an if statement that looked something like this.
if (arg == &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; || arg == &amp;#34;b&amp;#34; || arg == &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; || arg == &amp;#34;d&amp;#34; || arg == &amp;#34;e&amp;#34;) { Console.WriteLine(true); } An alternative way of writing this could look like this.
if (new [] { &amp;#34;a&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;d&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; }.Contains(arg)) Console.WriteLine(true); I can&amp;rsquo;t remember in which Github repository I spotted this technique, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure it was written in something other than C#.</description>

      <description>Blame no one but yourself. This is one of the few quotes I remember months after reading this book. Although it&amp;rsquo;s a harsh statement, there definitely is some truth to it.
Once I started observing my own behavior when faced with failure, I caught myself regularly blaming others for failures to which I am - at least - an accomplice.
Think about it. You might be guilty of this too.</description>

      <title>Daydreaming about jQuery Mobile and the WebAPI</title>

      <description>I recently blogged about programming for the future of mobile with jQuery Mobile and the WebAPI. You probably heard that jQuery Mobile 1.0 was released earlier this week. Although it will take a while before we will see some actual results from the WebAPI initiative, that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t keep us from letting our minds play with things that might be possible one day using the WebAPI.
The thoughts in this post were provoked by an interesting comment Kristof Claes left on my previous post.</description>

      <description>I have been working on something small on the side lately. I hardly have anything to show for it though, most of it is still being shaped in my head.
Anyhow, a very important part of the front-end is built using jQuery mobile. Although the framework hasn&amp;rsquo;t been released - release candidates are available though -, it&amp;rsquo;s something you should start looking into today. Why? Because the browser is the future of mobile applications.</description>

      <description>Just after graduating, I hated legacy with the heat of a thousand suns. I felt unfortunate, having to work on old code, built using outdated technologies, while software is all about making new and shiny things. Right, guys? Those naïve expectations of a rookie got crumbled very soon. Legacy is a constant in our industry. You can try to ignore it as long as possible, but it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to keep that up forever.</description>

      <description>I think The Art of Unit Testing targets a broad audience. Beginners will find every part of the book useful, where intermediates might be more interested in the final two parts.
Roy Osherove starts this book by laying a solid foundation of the unit testing concept. Why is testing important? What defines a good unit test, and how does a unit test differ from an integration test? In the second part of the book, he demonstrates the use of two core unit testing techniques: stubs and mocks.</description>

      <description>My mini-website arealdeveloper.com will no longer be available online after tomorrow.
I slapped it together over a weekend, trying out WebMatrix, which turned out to be the perfect companion for building small things.
A pleasant surprise was the mention of &amp;lsquo;A Real Developer&amp;rsquo; by the guys at Channel9. This made the traffic go through the roof for a few days.
A few months later the site was a ghosttown. But I don&amp;rsquo;t mind, had to happen.</description>

      <description>Something that can bother me tremendously is being surrounded by people who are in a constant state of being comfortably numb. People who don&amp;rsquo;t welcome change, try to scare away new concepts and are just too much at home in their comfort zone. Some are perfectly happy filling their days keeping up appearances of being busy. They don&amp;rsquo;t care about self-improvement, but only care about augmenting their paychecks by accumulating as much legacy baggage as possible, with the sole intention of being perceived as an irreplaceable asset to the company, whilst not having to leave their comfort zone.</description>

      <description>Due to the nature of things we build in our day to day job, writing software can wear out even the most fit of us.
Most software jobs make you constantly deal with complexity. The amount of things which can lead to a complex software project are immense. A poor first design, and failure to redesign. External dependencies, which seem to behave different every time around. Or just the complexity of the problems itself.</description>

      <description>The girlfriend and I returned from our West Coast roadtrip yesterday morning.
We found this trip to be an unforgettable experience, which made us even more hungry for future travels.
This blog will return to business as usual, with mainly technical content and opinions.
Here is an overview of our posts exploring the West Coast:

      <description>After seeing the celebrities at Madame Tussaud&amp;rsquo;s in Las Vegas, we went for the real deal.
Turns out Hollywood is a lot less glamourous than we expected. The Walk of Fame isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot different from any other gray sidewalk, paved with long-forgotten stars. The famous Hollywood sign isn&amp;rsquo;t even lit a night, making the contrast with Beverly Hills at the other side of town even bigger. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s another side to Hollywood that we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen, since we only stayed for two days, one of which at the Universal Studios.</description>

      <description>Driving back into the desert after our breakfast, with Las Vegas in the rear-view mirror, we secretly feel a little relieved to be heading back to the real world. The cocktail of fake pyramids, indoor jungles, Paris landmarks, castles and volcanoes became a little nauseating. With hotels and casinoes resembling labyrinths, designed to get people trapped inside, it feels liberating to drive through the wide open landscape again.
Some of the things we enjoyed the most were the late nights walking the Strip, watching free shows, standing on top of the Stratosphere and posing with the wax celebs at Madame Tussaud&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>We all know the Grand Canyon as one of the seven natural wonders of the world, today I learned why. As one of the locals described: &amp;lsquo;Pretty amazing for a big hole in the ground&amp;rsquo;. Being the closest to the south entrance, we visited the South Rim of the canyon. A trip to the visitor center taught us there were no easy hikes (except for the going down part), so we didn&amp;rsquo;t attempt at one.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, we drove from Saint-George to Page, Arizona. The Pipe Springs National Monument happened to be on our way, so we made a stop. Turned out there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to see. A 30-minute ranger-led tour made it worthwhile though. During the tour through the Winsor Castle, she told us about the Mormons who used to live there. The Fort manager, also head of their Mormon church, married 58 women, resulting in plenty of children to work the Fort.</description>

      <description>We started the day with a short drive to Zion National Park. On our way we came across some colossal rock formations, layered with different shades of red. Since the park is almost entirely car free, we took the shuttle bus along the scenic route. We got off at different stops, to take short hikes to the park&amp;rsquo;s natural treasures. The Emerald Pools were first up, followed by the Weeping Rock and a riverside walk to the Narrows, which are architected by the Virgin river.</description>

      <description>Yesterday evening we spent the night in a town called Tonopah, which is literally in the middle of nowhere. Today we continued our trip to Zion (Utah), driving hundreds of miles through the Nevada desert, getting sunburned on the way. There was not a soul in sight, except for cattle crossing the road, who seemed to be waiting for us to pass to say hello. We just arrived at St. George, which is a launching point to Zion National Park.</description>

      <description>These skyscrapers are, other than the enormous mountains, the redwood sequoia on top of them. Some of these trees are the same height as a thirty story building, which is higher than the Statue Of Liberty. It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to capture these giants on camera. 
After a short hike between the sequoia, we drove off to Yosemite Valley to discover the Yosemity Falls. Although the falls must be more impressive in Winter, they were still worth visiting.</description>

Financial District This part of town is definitely worth a visit. The multiplicity of skyscrapers merging into the San Francisco fog, is an impressive view. When the fog has gone, the shadows the buildings cast on each other are just as amazing.</description>

      <description>Last week, I resigned from my job at Ferranti Computer Systems. Three years ago, days after receiving my Graduate Diploma in Applied Computer Science, I had my first real-world working experience at Ferranti Computer Systems.
The first project I was assigned to, was a project for the Antwerp fire department. Along with two other graduates and four seniors, I was thrown in at the deep end. I always had solid grades in school, and was fairly confident that I grasped the material I was taught.</description>

      <description>The latest addition to my data structures and algorithms in JavaScript is the merge sort algorithm.
There are four main steps in the merge sort algorithm (from Wikipedia):
 If the list is of length 0 or 1, then it is already sorted. Otherwise: Divide the unsorted list into two sublists of about half the size. Sort each sublist recursively by re-applying the merge sort. Merge the two sublists back into one sorted list.</description>

So far, I have blogged about simple sorting algorithms, the stack data structure and the queue data structure. This week I have also implemented a doubly linked list. I started writing a post about that last implementation, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t like where it was going, so instead of writing about it, I have pushed everything to a public Git repository.</description>

      <description>I like to think of HTML5 Web Workers simply as &amp;lsquo;threading for the Web&amp;rsquo;.
Wikipedia describes it a bit more in detail.
 Web Workers define an API for running scripts, basically JavaScript, in the background independently of any user interface scripts. This allows for long-running scripts that are not interrupted by scripts that respond to clicks or other user interactions, and allows long tasks to be executed without yielding to keep the page responsive.</description>

      <description>Davy Brion made a comment on my JavaScript stack/queue implementation on Twitter last night: Any reason why you don&amp;rsquo;t immediately set elements to [] at declaration in your stack/queue example?
var elements; this.push = function(element) { if (typeof(elements) === &#39;undefined&#39;) { elements = []; } elements.push(element); }  Yes, I made an overoptimization, and a bad one. In this implementation, you save a few bytes in memory if you initialize the stack, but don&amp;rsquo;t push elements.</description>

      <description>Modern browsers keep making efforts to make the web a better place. One of those small, but so thoughtful features, is a way to tame unwanted dialogs.
If I run following JavaScript, Chrome and Firefox both help me disabling it.
for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1000; i++) { alert(&amp;quot;Annoying alert &amp;quot; + i); }  
Internet Explorer does not. Even if I kill the process of the tab, the tab will try to restore itself, forcing me to kill Internet Explorer as a whole.</description>

      <description>The second assignment in my &amp;lsquo;implementing data structures and algorithms in JavaScript&amp;rsquo; quest consists of two popular data structures: the stack and the queue.
The stack
 A stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) abstract data type and data structure. A stack can have any abstract data type as an element, but is characterized by only three fundamental operations: push, pop and stack top.
 Implementing this turned out to be pretty easy.</description>

      <description>About three years ago I graduated and got my degree in Applied Computer Science. Although it says Computer Science, we hardly ever focused on data structures and algorithms. Obviously, I now see that as a shortcoming. So I plan to make up for that by reading up on some of the basics. While at it, I might be blogging on some of the topics.
I am going to start by implementing some of the simple sorting algorithms in JavaScript.</description>

      <description>This is a decision that often needs to be made by middle management. For managers the most natural way to make this call is by evaluating the return on investment. To calculate the ROI, you need to compare the gain of an investment relative to the amount of investment. And this is exactly where things get hard, if not impossible. Measuring developer productivity is one of the unsolvable problems in our industry.</description>

      <description>I was lucky to pick up a copy of More Joel on Software for only 5 euros at a bookfest last week. Turns out the book ships pretty cheap on Amazon as well.
More Joel on Software was written by Joel Spolsky, already a legend for launching The Stack Exchange Network with Jeff Atwood. Although it&amp;rsquo;s hard to not know him, I admittedly hadn&amp;rsquo;t read a lot of his material so far.</description>

      <description>As more established bloggers have argued before, there is something essentially wrong with job interviews in our industry. Software companies hire developers without even making them touch a keyboard. As long as you talk the walk you are able to land yourself a decent position. There are complete lists of .NET interview questions out there, which should, with enough preparation, make it possible for a somewhat technologiable person to ace the average .</description>

      <description>With transitioning to ASP.NET MVC, I see our JavaScript codebase increasing exponentially. And this is a big win, unless we fail to keep that codebase maintainable. We mainly rely on jQuery to do our DOM manipulations, so it&amp;rsquo;s only logical for us to abstract those manipulations into reusable jQuery plugins.
So today, I wrote my first jQuery plugin and named it jRoll.
jRoll
jRoll is a plugin that finds all the (external) links in a jQuery object, and replaces the value of the href attribute with a value you specified.</description>

For those who are like &amp;ldquo;tl;dr&amp;rdquo;, here are my thoughts on WebMatrix..

      <description>A Real Developer is a side-project I built over the weekend poking around with WebMatrix.

It got a little out of hand. After publishing, I showed it to a few popular tweeps, and they were kind enough to mention it. 24 hours after the launch it has gotten over 3.5k unique visitors, 39k page views (see what I did there?) and over 240 submissions. Being mentioned by Scott Hanselman and Rey Bango helps.</description>

      <description>After publishing yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on anonymous type equality, I received an interesting comment from a fellow redditor. He stated that even if the sequence of the property assignment were the same, the equality comparison would still return false, because the types generated by the C# compiler are reference types, making their references being tested for equality and not their data.
This is very true, unless the Equals() method is overridden. And this is exactly what the compiler does for us when we define anonymous types.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you instantiate two variables (a and b) using anonymous types. They both have the same two properties (x and y) with equal values.
 1: var a = new { x = 1, y = 2 }; 2: var b = new { y = 2, x = 1 };  Do you think these two variables are equal?
 1: var areEquel = a.Equals(b); 2: Console.WriteLine(areEquel); //Prints false :O  These two variables are not equal.</description>

      <description>Hold it, don&amp;rsquo;t shoot me. I know this would be an awful practice, but it is an interesting C# compiler quirk nonetheless.
 Keywords are predefined reserved identifiers that have special meanings to the compiler. They cannot be used as identifiers in your program unless they include @ as a prefix. For example, @if is a legal identifier but if is not because it is a keyword.
 static void Main(string[] args) { var @if = &amp;quot;oh my.</description>

This book is mainly directed to (advertisement) designers, but since I feel that designers and developers do have a few things in common, we both like to create things, I also read it.
The content of this book is a collection of Paul Ardens observations on business and life presented in a very consumable format.</description>

      <title>Keeping WebSockets alive</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2011/03/keeping-websockets-alive/</guid>
      <description>The problem with using stateful connections on an imperfect place as the internet is that connections might drop. The server or an intermediary can drop the connection due to an idle timeout. Even a temporary problem at the server or a local network hiccup might kill your connection.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t prepared to handle these scenarios, you will not be able to fully rely on WebSockets.
A simple solution
The simplest solution is checking every few seconds whether the WebSocket is still opened.</description>

In my session I will be talking about WebSockets.
 WebSockets on Fire
While the WebSockets API specification is not stable yet, various browser vendors have already implemented a prototype in their latest browser versions. Microsoft released their WebSockets prototype in December 2010. While there is no native implementation of WebSockets in IE9 just yet, for now they are providing a solution which works cross-browser, relying on a Silverlight client.</description>

      <description>Even though our title says Developer, it&amp;rsquo;s hard for most of us to escape doing a system administrator task once in a while.
I had to add SQL Server Reporting Services to an existing SQL Server 2005 installation. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a big deal. Mount the SQL Server installation image, run the setup and follow the installation wizard to add extra components. Arriving at the step where I should be able to select Reporting Services, the Reporting Services option was grayed out.</description>

      <description>You usually are in a web context if you are working with JSON, where JSON serialization almost always is encapsulated by the framework. You might accidentally come across scenarios where you want to serialize and deserialize JSON in a non-web context though.
Turns out this is fairly trivial since .NET 3.5. .NET 3.5 added the JavaScriptSerializer class. You can find this class in the System.Web.Script.Serialization namespace. To access this namespace you need to reference the System.</description>

Hello World
Hosting your own application using Kayak is relatively simple.
In this example I&amp;rsquo;m using a console application to run the Kayak webserver. This application has one dependency: the Kayak project.
First create a new instance of the DotNetServer. This class is an IKayakServer implementation using System.NET.Sockets.Socket. Once the instance is created you can call the Start() method.</description>

If you have installed the WebSockets prototype, you should be able to browse to http://localhost/chat/wsdemo.html and stroll through the internals with me.

Dependencies

In this post I will lead you through the process of installing the WebSockets prototype on your machine. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working chat web application sample.
Download
First you need to download and run the WebSockets prototype installer.
This package installs the binaries and samples in the %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\WCF WebSockets\10.</description>

      <description>One of the new features in the IE9 developer tools Giorgio Sardo demoed at TechEd Europe, is the Format JavaScript tool. This tool can be very useful when you want to reverse engineer a minified script.
You can find this feature in the toolbox on the Script tab.

This is how jquery.min.js looks after formatting.

This feature is not available in the public beta (9.0.7.9360.16406), but should be available in the latest platform previews.</description>

      <title>HTML5: Exception handling with the Geolocation API</title>

      <description>In my previous post on the Geolocation API I passed in a PositionErrorCallback to the geolocation.getCurrentPosition() method. When I received this callback I displayed a generic message informing the user something went wrong. In real-world scenarios you probably want the message to be more specific. You might also want to call a specific fallback method depending on what went wrong.
This is where the PositionError argument of the PositionErrorCallback comes in handy.</description>

      <description>I read about the HTML5 Geolocation API in the Pro HTML5 Programming book a while ago, and decided to play with it on this lazy Sunday.
Using the Geolocation API to make a one-shot position request is very straight-forward. Get a reference to the navigator.geolocation object and call the getCurrentPosition() method, passing in at least a PositionCallback. In this example I&amp;rsquo;m also passing in a PositionErrorCallback. In the PositionCallback you can examine the properties of the position object.</description>

      <description>In my first post on the HTML5 javascript Selector API I wondered how the new methods querySelector() and querySelectorAll() would influence jQuery.
At the time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information on the subject, but yesterday I found out that jQuery has been taking advantage of these new methods since version 1.4.3.
From the release notes..

      <description>A cool feature of Internet Explorer 9 is the msPerformance API. This API helps you to accurately measure the performance of a webpage. A lot of developers have built their own performance measurement constructs over the years, based on the Date function, but the results of these constructs can be way off!
John Resig (jQuery inventor) has an in detail blogpost where he discovers where custom javascript execution time measurement goes wrong.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I blogged on new addittions to the javascript Selector API: querySelector() and querySelectorAll(). These two new methods enable you to find elements by matching against a group of selectors. I only scratched the surface in the previous post, that&amp;rsquo;s why you can find a few more examples in this post. These examples should demonstrate the power and ease of use of the new Selector API features. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to show you all of the selectors usages in just one post, that&amp;rsquo;s why I strongly encourage you to have a look at the W3C Selectors specifications.</description>

      <description>Generating tagclouds is nothing new. People have been generating tagclouds server-side since the seventies. Lately more and more tagclouds are being generated client-side.
There is nothing wrong with generating tagclouds server-side. Telerik has a great tagcloud server control. Generating tagclouds server-side can bring some overhead though, so depending on the scenario and the requirements you might decide to do it client-side. There are a ton of fancy ready-to-use jQuery tagcloud plug-ins out there.</description>

This is one of those things I always forget. You can&amp;rsquo;t use variables in your case statements because the C# compiler doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to. It&amp;rsquo;s very logical though, the compiler forces you to use constants because otherwise there is no way of knowing there are equal case statements.</description>

Losing the LinqIn the previous iteration I used Linq to search my dictionary.

The only drawback is that you can&amp;rsquo;t edit or delete your uploaded pages in an easy way yet. It is ad free, but I guess there will be some advertisements in the future when hosting costs increase.
You can make a POST request to upload a page through their public API.</description>

      <description>Doing batch operations and elegantly handling exceptions is a problem which every developer has faced before. In .NET 3.5 or older there is no out-of-the-box solution to handle exceptions in these types of scenarios, without being inconsistent to the normal flow of exception handling. .NET 4 introduces the AggregateException; an exception representing multiple exceptions. The AggregateException was introduced in the first place to be used with the parallel framework, but it can be used in other scenarios as well, such as batch operations.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started reading the excellent paper &amp;ldquo;Patterns for Parallel Programming: Understanding and Applying Parallel Patterns with the .NET Framework 4&amp;quot;.
There is a section in this whitepaper which explains perfectly why parallel programming was and still is such an interesting problem.
 Consider an analogy: shopping with some friends at a grocery store. You come into the store with a grocery list, and you rip the list into one piece per friend, such that every friend is responsible for retrieving the elements on his or her list.</description>

      <description>The people who follow my blog might remember the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 series. In these series I showed some of the core features of the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 beta javascript library.
In January Microsoft told us that they would ship the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 library as a part of the Microsoft Ajax framework, together with the release of ASP.NET 4.0. A few days ago I was ready to dig in the library a little deeper, but I found out that most of the documentation and resources I used to consult, had moved or had disappeared.</description>

      <description>While I was playing with my UDPListener I needed a small tool which could send some UDP packets to a certain hostname and port. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wrote a console application which uses an UdpClient to send some UDP packets. It&amp;rsquo;s quick and dirty, but it serves the cause.
 1: namespace UdpSender 2: { 3: class Program 4: { 5: //Constants 6: private const string HOSTNAME = &amp;quot;LocalHost&amp;quot;; 7: private const int PORT = 800; 8: private const int TIMES = 5; 9: private const string MESSAGE = &amp;quot;This is a TestMessage&amp;quot;; 10: private const int SLEEP = 50; 11: 12: static void Main(string[] args) 13: { 14: using (UdpClient client = new UdpClient()) 15: { 16: //Connect 17: client.</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how can you listen for UDP packets in a Windows service.
OnStartWhen the service starts, I set the started flag to true, initialize the ManualResetEvent, initialize an UdpClient and a WorkingThread. The ManualResetEvent will help us on a later stage to make our service stop elegantly.
 1: protected override void OnStart(string[] args) 2: { 3: Start(); 4: } 5: 6: public void Start() 7: { 8: m_started = true; 9: 10: m_stop = new ManualResetEvent(false); 11: 12: InitializeUdpListener(); 13: InitializeWorkingThread(); 14: }  InitializingFirst we need to initialize an IPEndpoint.</description>

      <description>In this post a small workaround for disabled select not showing selected options in IE8. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not the cleanest fix, but it get&amp;rsquo;s the job done.
ProblemA disabled select does not highlight the selected options.
 1: &amp;lt;select size=&amp;quot;3&amp;quot; multiple=&amp;quot;multiple&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;mySelect&amp;quot; disabled=&amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot;&amp;gt; 2: &amp;lt;option selected=&amp;quot;selected&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;Option1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Option 1&amp;lt;/option&amp;gt; 3: &amp;lt;option selected=&amp;quot;selected&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;Option2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Option 2&amp;lt;/option&amp;gt; 4: &amp;lt;option value=&amp;quot;Option3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Option 3&amp;lt;/option&amp;gt; 5: &amp;lt;/select&amp;gt;  
SolutionThe following CSS provides a workaround. It looks pretty similar to the appearance we are used to.</description>

      <description>Although I&amp;rsquo;ve made my feet wet with various JavaScript frameworks, I am not a JavaScript hero at all. This might be one of the disadvantages of being a WebForms developer and having great toolkits at hand like the AJAX Control Toolkit and Telerik RADControls.
Because you really can&amp;rsquo;t call yourself a webdeveloper without having some understanding of JavaScript I decided to order Object-Oriented Javascript by Stoyan Stefanov.
This book really handles the language itself.</description>

      <description>If you missed part 1, you can find it here.
Use the built-in goodiesASP.NET Webforms has a lot of good stuff built into it. Do your homework before you start building the next big Webforms thing! A perfect example of this is ASP.NET Membership. ASP.NET provides an out-of-box membership solution. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people who were to lazy to do some research or thought they could do better and ended up with a solution which put its doors wide open to people with bad intentions.</description>

I often use string.Format() to format my log messages. Earlier this morning I made a typo formatting my message and an Exception was thrown in the beginning of my method which caused the application flow to break. You can avoid this by using the DebugFormat() method.</description>

 A tourist once visited a temple under construction where he saw a sculptor making an idol of God. Suddenly he noticed a similar idol lying nearby. Surprised, he asked the sculptor, &amp;ldquo;Do you need two statues of the same idol?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; said the sculptor without looking up, &amp;ldquo;We need only one, but the first one got damaged at the last stage.</description>

 You can use the ViewStateMode property to enable view state for an individual control even if view state is disabled for the page.

      <description>Todays post is a very small tip.
I saw the question &amp;ldquo;How to add leading zeros to a number&amp;rdquo; on the ASP.NET forums countless times before. And often the answers provide solutions that work, but are overkill as well.
The two cleanest methods I know are String.Format and PadLeft.
 1: Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Using .ToString()&amp;quot;); 2: Console.WriteLine(String.Format(&amp;quot;{0:0000}&amp;quot;, 16)); 3: 4: Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;-------------------&amp;quot;); 5: 6: Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Using .PadLeft()&amp;quot;); 7: Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToString(16).PadLeft(4, &#39;0&#39;));  You can see the result here.</description>

      <description>One of the new features in ASP.NET 4.0 is permanently redirecting to a page using Response.RedirectPermanent.
 It is common practice in Web applications to move pages and other content around over time, which can lead to an accumulation of stale links in search engines. In ASP.NET, developers have traditionally handled requests to old URLs by using by using the Response.Redirect method to forward a request to the new URL. However, the Redirect method issues an HTTP 302 Found (temporary redirect) response, which results in an extra HTTP round trip when users attempt to access the old URLs.</description>

In the intranet webapplications world customers pretty often ask to show a warning when a user leaves a page (by closing the browser, closing a tab, clicking a link,..). This feature is specifically very interesting for data-input-driven webforms where one wrong click can make ten minutes of work undone.
Last week I had to implement this feature in a huge webform which is causing lots of postbacks (firing the onbeforeunload event).</description>

1. Not using the right format for the name of a local resources fileThe format of the name of a local resources file should be: PageName.PageExtension.resx.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t add the page extension (Aspx, Ascx), you will get the Exception &amp;ldquo;The resource object with key &amp;lsquo;PageTitle&amp;rsquo; was not found.&amp;quot;.
2. Not adding an App_LocalResources folder to each subfolderEach subfolder must have it&amp;rsquo;s own App_LocalResources folder, else ASP.</description>

      <description>Often code reviews are done by one person, the technical lead of your team.
In my opinion it&amp;rsquo;s better to make each developer of your team do code reviews.
My arguments Having all developers doing code reviews enforces well-documented coding standards.. Which also leads to discussions about what these codings tandards should be. Each developer is forced to understand the workflow of an application which isn&amp;rsquo;t his, which expands his domain knowledge.</description>

      <description>Like the title says, I had a little chat with Arjan Zuidhof from Arjan&amp;rsquo;s World.
Arjan has a opinionated linkblog, on which he posts on a daily basis.
Here it goes..
Next to blogging, what do you do for a living?I&amp;rsquo;m a thirty-something developer from the Netherlands working as an inhouse .NET developer in a big company, somewhere in the Randstad (western part of the country). I mainly work on projects related to customer data in the broadest sense.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the use of stored procedures lately.
Some questions that popped up in my head: What are the advantages/disadvantages? When and how should they be used? Will they extinct with LINQ to SQL becoming more and more popular? Why should you store your queries in your database, instead of in your code..
I asked the opinion of a few ASP.NET/.NET professionals. Hope you find this interesting!

      <description>This is part II of the interview with Curt Christianson. For Part I go here.
Part 2: Technology Let me ask you some general questions about building a web application. What is your advise on setting up the layers of a web application. In the web application I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on we chose a not so standard architecture I guess. We have multiple &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo;, which are folders in practice. In the root of these modules we hold our aspx pages.</description>

      <description>This week I decided to buy a new PC, because my old one was randomly rebooting, was really out-of-date and because I deserved it.
My old PC had turned into a Frankenstein PC over the years, that&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to write a little summary of the modifications I did to it over the years.

 My new PC only had a 40GB hard drive, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t that big of a problem at first.</description>
