<h3 id="the-zen-and-art-of-motor-cycle-maintenance">The Zen and Art of Motor Cycle Maintenance</h3>
<p>The author is a tormented soul on a quest to define quality. You&rsquo;re his
passenger, driving shot gun on a CB77 Super Hawk, in for an exhausting
intellectual journey through the high mountains of reasoning. You will
often fear getting lost and feel slightly anxious that the driver might
drive of a cliff any moment, but he won&rsquo;t. Once you see the top of the
mountain for the first time, you&rsquo;ll be happy he doesn&rsquo;t make it too easy
on you, and you&rsquo;ll be more appreciative of the road that took you there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the process of fixing the machine things always come up,
low-quality things, from a dusted knuckle to an accidentally ruined
“irreplaceable” assembly. These drain off gumption, destroy enthusiasm
and leave you so discouraged you want to forget the whole business. I
call these things “gumption traps.” </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Peace of mind isn’t at all superficial to technical work. It’s the
whole thing. That which produces it is good work and that which
destroys it is bad work. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s the style that gets you; technological ugliness syruped over with
romantic phoniness in an effort to produce beauty and profit by people
who, though stylish, don’t know where to start because no one has ever
told them there’s such a thing as Quality in this world and it’s real,
not style.</p>

<h3 id="the-soul-of-a-new-machine">The Soul of a New Machine</h3>
<p>The type of writing I wish there was more of. It&rsquo;s the closest I&rsquo;ll ever
get to experience building a mini-computer. It makes one appreciate how
much we&rsquo;re standing on the shoulders of giants. So much has changed in
40 years and even more hasn&rsquo;t changed at all. People will be people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adopting a remote, managerial point of view, you could say that the
Eagle project was a case where a local system of management worked as
it should: competition for resources creating within a team inside a
company an entrepreneurial spirit, which was channeled in the right
direction by constraints sent down from the top. But it seems more
accurate to say that a group of engineers got excited about building a
computer. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the sixties there was proposed a “National Data Bank,” which would,
theoretically, improve the government’s efficiency by allowing
agencies to share information. The fact that such a system could be
abused did not mean it would be, proponents said; it could be
constructed in such a way as to guarantee benign use. Nonsense, said
opponents, who managed to block the proposal; no matter what the
intent or the safeguards, the existence of such a system would
inevitably lead toward the creation of a police state.</p>

<h3 id="winter-is-coming-why-vladimir-putin-and-the-enemies-of-the-free-world-must-be-stopped">Winter is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get better educated on the history of world
politics and long-lasting international conflicts. Growing up in Western
Europe with very little direct conflict, you&rsquo;re never really taught why
other parts of the world seem to be so messed up and why they&rsquo;re so
angry at us.</p>
<p>Although you might find Kasparov to be a bit <em>too</em> convincing, he has
good reasons to hold strong opinions and is in a unique position to shed
light on what&rsquo;s been happening under the Putin regime. It&rsquo;s like
listening to someone who just escaped an abusive relationship. I was
remembered of Hintjens&rsquo; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1514342022/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diofanedebyje-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1514342022&amp;linkId=d4389546b4a3f69246ef5b49d3beed13">The Psychopath
Code</a>
more than once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like a weed, evil can be cut back but never entirely uprooted. It
waits for its chance to spread through the cracks in our vigilance. It
can take root in the fertile soil of our complacency, or even the
rocky rubble of the fallen Berlin Wall. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, compromises on
principles are the streetlights. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He and his junta have turned the country into a petro-state, and
exporting natural resources to an insatiable global market doesn’t
require entrepreneurs or programmers, let alone writers and
professors. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Putin and his defenders abroad bragged about Russia’s rising GDP, but
it was like taking the average temperature of all the patients in a
hospital. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The hypocrisy of condemning weak dictatorships while embracing strong
ones destroys American and European credibility and undermines any
attempt at global leadership; in fact, it seems to encourage smaller
autocracies to aspire to greater ambitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="shows">Shows</h2>
<h3 id="westworld">Westworld</h3>
<p>In a not so distant future, the rich will be spending their free time
visiting amusement parks inhabited by lifelike robots. Once you pay your
entry ticket, you can be the protagonist of any story you want. Maybe
you want good value for money and go on an epic quest chasing a bad guy
to the edge of the park, or maybe you just want to drink, gamble and
maybe kill a few randoms for fun in the saloon just feet away from the
drop-off point? Like playing Red Dead Redemption post-virtual reality.</p>
<p>The setting, cast and especially the story line are out of this world.
Reading up on fan theories after the show is half the fun. It&rsquo;s amazing
how many plausible theories were put out and how a small community is
able to dissect every little scene looking for hints to figure out the
park&rsquo;s mysterious past.</p>
<p>This show made me question if I understood what it is that makes us
human. Aren&rsquo;t we all just the result of our pre-programmed genetics and
the events we experience throughout our lives?</p>

<h3 id="stranger-things-2">Stranger Things 2</h3>
<p>I just finished watching this one last night. It&rsquo;s like reading a
really good Stephen King novel, but in color. I noticed yesterday&rsquo;s
season finale was 61 minutes long; good things do happen when you&rsquo;re not
constrained to TV time.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2018-01-03-consumed-in-2017-st.jpg"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2018-01-03-consumed-in-2017-st.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<p>Commutes have gotten earlier and longer this year. I&rsquo;ve cut back on the
technology podcasts in favor of a more broad range of topics.</p>
<h3 id="the-joe-rogan-experience">The Joe Rogan Experience</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like sitting in on a conversation between two people at a
bar. One person is a talkative and enjoyable guy, not afraid to ask
questions and the other is happy to drop knowledge on a specific (and
often fringe) topic. Topics range from diet and fitness, to economy and
politics. Some episodes that stood out for me recently are the ones with
<a href="http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/colin-moriarty-3">Colin Moriarty</a>
and <a href="http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/nina-teicholz">Nina
Teicholz</a>.</p>
<h3 id="conversations-with-tyler">Conversations with Tyler</h3>
<p>The same concept, being a one-on-one conversation covering a wide
range of topics. However, this one is more formal and often a bit (too?)
academic. This podcast on <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-larry-summers-blog-secular-stagnation-twitter-421a69ed84c8">Marcroeconomics, Mentorship and Avoiding
Complacency</a>
might give you a good idea on what to expect.</p>
<h3 id="dan-carlins-history-x">Dan Carlin&rsquo;s History X</h3>
<p>Extremely thoroughly researched lectures on important periods of our
history. <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-59-the-destroyer-of-worlds/">The Destroyer of
Worlds</a>
is a 6 hour long, but captivating piece on the history of nuclear
warfare and filled in a lot of gaps for me.</p>
