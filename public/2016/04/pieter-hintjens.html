				<p>Writing doesn&rsquo;t necessarily always come naturally to me. It often takes
me days, weeks or even months of toying with an idea, before I think
it&rsquo;s mature enough to put it down into writing. I can&rsquo;t afford that
luxury this time though, I wouldn&rsquo;t think of myself as much of a friend
if Pieter didn&rsquo;t get to read this in time.</p>
<p>I met Pieter the first time in a bar in Vilnius, December 2013, I
accidentally ended up sitting next to him during the traditional
pre-conf drinks. The first thing that stood out, was what a comfortable
warm sweater he was wearing - I still cherish the memory of that grey
woolen sweater on cold winter nights. I&rsquo;m still unsure whether it was
the sweater or his undeniable radiant charisma that made its way into my
memories. When Pieter talks, people tend to listen, or at least pay
attention. That&rsquo;s what I ended up doing that night - listening, sipping
in the knowledge, afraid to make a fool out of myself joining the
conversation.</p>
<p>That next day Pieter opened the conference with probably the most
motivational keynote I ever attended, aptly titled &ldquo;Building stuff
changes everything&rdquo;. Him being a fellow countryman and me having a few
Lithuanian beers in me, helped me gather enough courage to properly
introduce myself and talk for a bit.</p>
<p>From that moment on, we would only meet a few times a year, traveling to
Vilnius with the Belgian delegation or as a guest at the Domain Driven
Design Belgium meetup. During that time, we had a few - far from enough - lengthy conversations. Me mostly asking questions, him sharing his
point of view, and me trying hard to keep up, taking it all in. Although
he was always more than happy to entertain each question you would throw
at him, I would always feel a bit selfish keeping him to myself for too
long.</p>
<p>The most memorable talk I had with Pieter was during a tête-à-tête in
the Vilnius sky bar. We would mingle Dutch and English, whichever
language made the next sentence sound best. We shared some personal
experiences, he laid out most of the groundwork for what a good year
later materialized into &ldquo;The Psychopath Code&rdquo;, but most importantly he
allowed me a peek through his eyes, looking at his playground we like to
call life.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need his Mensa membership card, to realize he is a highly
gifted individual. He could have pursued anything he wanted and been
good at it, but <strong>he chose all-out for people, freedom and love</strong> -
making it his mission to evangelize his core beliefs.</p>
<p>His words - both spoken and written - have inspired me more than he can
imagine. And they will likely continue to inspire others for many more
years to come. <strong>His work has given me a framework to build on for the
rest of my life. There&rsquo;s so much to learn from how he is capable of
dissecting the world, to document things that are broken and his
tireless effort to make it whole again - one protocol, one word, one hug
at a time.</strong> Where I would often feel overwhelmed by dark hopeless
sentiments, he has given me enough tools to overcome those. From his
mouth to my heart: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not much more than a pile of ants, but
together we can achieve tremendous things&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Pieter, I&rsquo;m not half the writer you are, but I hope these words can
serve as a testimony to your children what a great dad they had. If your
time comes, know that I&rsquo;m grateful that I&rsquo;ve been able to call you my
friend.</p>
