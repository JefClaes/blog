				<p>Seems that it&rsquo;s impossible to beat the Gaussian curve of blogging
frequency. On the other hand, I spent quite some of my mental blogging
budget on an interview with InfoQ.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit bummed out that it&rsquo;s such a large wall of text. When submitting the answers, I highlighted some snippets which should make for easier scanning. Too bad the formatting was lost when publishing it. I included some highlights below.</p>
<p>The interview itself can be found <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/08/software-devs-ddd-drive-business">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Extracting components:</strong> Starting out, this can be as trivial as
trying to model boundaries as namespaces or modules. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Invariants:</strong> Having core properties enforced deep within the model,
allows for a better night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sizing aggregates:</strong> Make your aggregates as small as they can be,
but not any smaller. There&rsquo;s a big difference between an invariant
that needs to be strongly held and data that helps the aggregate to
make a decision, but which doesn&rsquo;t require strong consistency. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ORM pitfalls:</strong> Being able to navigate through a graph, which
basically walks through your whole database, is a great way to lose
any sense of transactional boundaries. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The value of bounded contexts:</strong> Now when I switch between bounded
contexts, it feels like walking through a door, entering a separate
room where you can tackle a problem with an unbiased mindset, allowing
you to use the right tool for the job. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Introducing domain events:</strong> When you don&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t afford
to invest in the full paradigm shift there&rsquo;s a middle ground. You can
try a hybrid approach in which you, next to persisting state, also
persist the events that led up to a specific state. This does entail
the risk of introducing a bug which causes split-brain in which your
events do not add up to your state.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Designing contracts:</strong> If you get the semantics wrong, you will end
up with a system that&rsquo;s held together by brittle contracts that break
constantly.</p>
