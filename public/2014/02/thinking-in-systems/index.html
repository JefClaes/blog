Systems</a>
is a primer on the subject of system thinking written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donella_Meadows">Donella H.
Meadows</a>. The book is
divided into three parts. The first part explains the basic concepts of
system thinking using everyday systems. The second part covers why
systems work so well, why they still surprise us, how to avoid common
system traps and how to take advantage of some of the opportunities they
present. The last part, and for me the most interesting part, shows
where to intervene in a system and how to live in a world of systems.</p>
<p>Although the subject is pretty involved, the material is presented in a
very consumable fashion, preparing you for more academic material. This
is probably <em>the book</em> to read when you want to be introduced to systems
thinking.</p>
<p>Here are the sections I highlighted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone or everything in a system can act dutifully and rationally,
yet all these well-meaning actions too often add up to a perfectly
terrible result.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You think that because you understand &ldquo;one&rdquo; that you must therefore
understand &ldquo;two&rdquo; because one and one make two. But you forget that you
must also understand &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Purposes are deducted from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated
goals. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Enough central control to achieve coordination toward the large-system
goal, and enough autonomy to keep all subsystems flourishing,
functioning and self-organizing. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you become a manager, you probably will stop seeing labor as a
deserving partner in production, and start seeing it as a cost to be
minimized. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The structure of a commons systems makes selfish behavior much more
convenient and profitable than behavior that is responsible to the
whole community and to the future. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the desired system state is good education, measuring that goal by
the amount of money spent per student will ensure money spent per
student. If the quality of education is measured by performance on
standardized tests, the system will produce performance on
standardized tests. Whether either of these measures is correlated
with good education is at least worth thinking about. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a systematic tendency on the part of human beings to avoid
accountability for their own decisions. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to understand the deepest malfuctions of systems, pay
attention to the rules and who has power over them. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So how do you change paradigms? You keep pointing at the anomalies and
failures in the old paradigms. You keep speaking and acting, loudly
and with assurance, from the new one. You insert people with the new
paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don&rsquo;t waste
time with reactionaries; rather, you work with active change agents
and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If no paradigm is right, you can choose whatever one will help to
achieve your purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s something within the human mind that is attracted to straight
lines and not curves, to whole numbers and not fractions, to
uniformity and not diversity, and to certainties and not mystery.</p>
</blockquote>
