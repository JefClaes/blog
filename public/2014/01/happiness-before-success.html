				<p>Somewhere in the beginning of last century, two shoes salesmen were sent
to Africa hoping to expand their employer&rsquo;s market. Both salesmen
reported home within days of their arrival. The first salesman wrote:
&ldquo;This trip turned out to be a waste of time; the locals are not wearing
any shoes.&rdquo; The second salesman wrote something similar, yet very
different: &ldquo;This is looking very promising; people aren&rsquo;t wearing any
shoes yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A group of seventy year olds was invited to spend a week in a remote
location where everything was arranged to make it feel as if they went
back in time twenty years; they would get to read old news papers, were
shown recorded television shows etc&hellip; They were also asked to talk
about their jobs and kids as if it were twenty years ago. Once the week
was over, medical exams showed extraordinary results. Their health had
improved noticeably; their eyesight improved, their blood pressure went
down, their posture had changed&hellip;</p>
<p>In another experiment, a group of people was trained into using a new
piece of software. Half of the class was taught to prevent errors from
happening, while the other half was encouraged to make mistakes. A test
afterwards showed that the group that had learned by making mistakes was
a lot faster and efficient using the software than the group that was
taught to avoid errors at all costs.</p>
<p>The mind is incredibly powerful; it&rsquo;s in full control of how we perceive
things. One might be poor, having to live off a few dollars a day, and
be perfectly content with his situation. While someone on the other side
of the world might have everything he can imagine at his fingertips, but
be completely miserable.</p>
<p>Popular belief dictates that if you work hard, you will eventually
become successful, and once you&rsquo;re successful, then you&rsquo;ll be happy.
This recipe is elementally flawed. With each victory, we put our eyes on
that next big thing, never arriving at happiness.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307591549/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307591549&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=diofanedebyje-20">The Happiness
Advantage</a>,
Shawn Achor starts by claiming that we have it all wrong, and that it&rsquo;s
actually the other way round; happiness leads to success. Positive
brains make us more efficient, creative, thoughtful and productive,
boosting performance at work and at home. While the first few pages make
a great sales pitch, the rest of the book differs from the usual life
improvement charlatans backing up this hypothesis with narratives and
DIY practices extracted from modern happiness research.</p>
<p>The book turned out to be a very casual read; the writing is easy and it
only counts two hundred small pages - I finished it in a few hours. It
has inspired me to try and be more conscious about how I deal with
certain things, to always focus on the good, not allowing negativity to
slowly poison me.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes from the book</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If all you strive is diminishing the bad, you&rsquo;ll only attain the
average and you&rsquo;ll miss out entirely on the opportunity to exceed the
average. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness is not just a mood - it&rsquo;s a work ethic. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It takes about three positive comments, experiences, or expressions to
fend off the languishing effects of one negative. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness is not about lying to ourselves, or turning a blind eye to
the negative, but about adjusting our brain so that we see the ways to
rise above our circumstances.<br>
The fastest way to disengage an employee is to tell him his work is
meaningful only because of the paycheck. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Constantly scanning the world for the negative comes with a great
cost. It undercuts our creativity, raises our stress levels, and
lowers our motivation and ability to accomplish goals. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Common sense is not common action. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t the key to sustaining positive change be to turn each desired
action into a habit, so that it would come automatically, without much
effort, thought, or choice? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This invisible pull toward the path of least resistance can dictate
more of our lives than we realize, creating an impassible barrier to
change and positive growth. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lower the activation energy for habits you want to adopt, and raise it
for habits you want to avoid.</p>
</blockquote>
