				<p>With the Belgian &lsquo;Summer&rsquo; ending, we are exploring South Eastern Europe.
This trip will take us through Germany, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia.</p>
<p>On Saturday, we stopped in Stuttgart to complete our list of visits to
the three most popular European sports car museums, <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/07/ferrari-red-lamborghini-yellow.html">after visiting
Lamborghini and Ferrari two years
ago</a>:
the Porsche museum. In my teens, my affinity to fast cars was ignited by
spending rainy afternoons at one of my best friends&rsquo;s, attempting to
crush each other&rsquo;s track records playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Porsche_Unleashed">Need For Speed Porsche
Unleashed</a>.
The brand has succeeded in making its way into my subconscious early on.
It would still be a Porsche I&rsquo;d buy today, if I would have too much
money to spend.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, my interest for fast cars has tempered, making place
for a more general interest in the combination of good design and raw
engineering. There was certainly a place for this at the Porsche museum.
The architecture sets high expectations. Every detail in the building
met Porsche&rsquo;s standards; from the toilet pictograms to the elevator
interior.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like in most car museums, they fail to really capture the
driving experience. Not once did I hear the trademark roar of a Porsche
engine, which I learned to love playing video games.</p>

<p>Leaving Stuttgart behind us, we set out for Bled, Slovenia. This took us
through Austria, where we diverged far from the optimal route to visit
Hallstatt. This small village, famous around the world, even coined as
one of the most beautiful places on earth, is hidden deep into the
inhospitable landscape of Austria. Being so out-of-the-way might just be
what has made it possible to preserve the charm of this little place.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting back into the car, it started
raining, and it didn&rsquo;t stop until we crossed the Slovenian border. The
type of rain that gives you that claustrophobic car wash feeling. We
arrived in Bled well after dark, and went to bed curious of what our
surroundings would look like in the morning sun.Â <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
