				<p>When you visit a real casino, the constant busy-ness is overwhelming;
players spamming buttons, pulling levers, spinning the wheel, gambling
on the outcome of sports games, playing cards, feeding the machine,
cashing out, breaking bills, ordering drinks or even buying a souvenir.
A single player will easily generate a thousand transactions in one
sitting.</p>
<p>When you look at an online casino, this isn&rsquo;t very different. In the
system we inherited, the biggest and busiest aggregate by far is a
user&rsquo;s account. Basically every action that has money involved, leads to
activity on this aggregate.<br>
This makes sense. An account is an important consistency boundary, if
not the most important one. Casino&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t afford to have people spend
more than their account&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re applying optimistic concurrency, bursts of activity would
occasionally lead to transactional failures. Looking at a real casino,
it&rsquo;s easy to see why they aren&rsquo;t running into these types of issues.<br>
In a physical casino, it&rsquo;s only the owner of the wallet that gets to
access it. Casino employees are not allowed to take a player&rsquo;s wallet
out of his pocket to make a transaction. There is no concurrent use of a
player&rsquo;s wallet: single spender principle.<br>
Online on the other hand, we aren&rsquo;t constrained by common courtesy and
have no problem reaching into a user&rsquo;s pocket. It&rsquo;s common to have a
user playing the slots, while we automatically try to pay out a
sportsbetting win once the results of a game are in.</p>
<p>Mapping out an aggregate&rsquo;s eventstream on a timeline is a great way to
visualize its lifecycle and usage patterns. When we did this for an
account, we came up with something that looked like this.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2014-11-09-splitting-hot-aggregates-AggregateTimeline.png"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2014-11-09-splitting-hot-aggregates-AggregateTimeline.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Activity peaks when a user starts a game. Each bet and each win drags in
the account aggregate. When you know that some players make thirty bets
per minute, it should be of no surprise that other processes accessing
the account in the background might introduce transactional failures.</p>
<p>Inspired by a real casino, I wonder if users online would appreciate it
if we stayed out of their pockets and let them do it for us instead.<br>
Instead of paying out sportsbetting winnings automatically, we could
notify a user that his bet was settled and that he can head over to his
bet and cash out the winnings to his account any time.<br>
The same goes for games; instead of cashing out wins to a player&rsquo;s
account after each bet, we could - like in a casino - cumulate all
winnings in the slot machine itself, also known as a game session, for
the player to cash out by pushing a button once he&rsquo;s done playing. To
reduce the amount of small bets taken from the account, we could also
encourage users to feed the slot machine before they start playing.</p>
<p>In practice, we would extract behaviour out of the account aggregate and
move it into the sportsbet and game session aggregates. It wouldn&rsquo;t be
until the end of their lifecycles, that we would involve the account
aggregate to move money around.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2014-11-09-splitting-hot-aggregates-AggregateTimeline2.png"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2014-11-09-splitting-hot-aggregates-AggregateTimeline2.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>By spreading activity to other and shorter lived aggregates, and having
the player do a bit of our work, we could reduce the amount of
concurrency on the account aggregate and end up with less transactional
failures.</p>
<p>But can we really expect of users to cash out manually? Probably not,
but we can still use most of the mechanics we just came up with, but
cash out automatically. We can cash out winnings automatically when a
user leaves a game session. We can queue up sportsbetting winnings and
cash out when a user isn&rsquo;t playing a game.</p>
<p>By exploring alternatives, we discovered that we can work the model to
reduce activity and concurrency on the account aggregate, lowering the
chances for transactional failures. Now, it&rsquo;s only fair to say that
there are other, more technical, options. The most obvious one would
probably be making the existing transactions on the account aggregate
shorter, also lowering the chance of concurrent use of the account.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but guess the actor model might be a better fit for this
type of problem.</p>
