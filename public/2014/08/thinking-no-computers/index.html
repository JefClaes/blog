				<p>The other day I happened to see a curious exchange in one of our
businesses. The cashier swapped a torn, but carefully restored by taping
it together again, Euro bill for a new one with the manager.
Inquisitive, I asked the manager what he was planning to do with that
Euro bill. &ldquo;Once a month, I take all those ripped up or badly worn bills
to the National Bank, and trade them for new ones. All you need is one
piece of the bank note for them to give you a newly printed one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he started taking care of some other paper work, my mind started
racing towards how the National Bank made this system work. I had
noticed before that bank notes have an identifier on each side. I
figured the National Bank probably stores the identifier of each note
they trade, so people don&rsquo;t go ripping up bank notes with the intent of
trading them twice. That seems easy enough, no?</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2014-08-19-thinking-no-computers-Papernote.png"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2014-08-19-thinking-no-computers-Papernote.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Once the manager finished up his paperwork, I wanted to confirm my idea
and asked if he knew how that system worked. How do they avoid people
cheating? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really simple actually, you need to own more than 50% of
a bill for it to be tradable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well&hellip; that&rsquo;s a much simpler solution. No need to store all the traded
notes somewhere, you probably don&rsquo;t even need a computer at all.</p>
<p>I catch myself regularly defaulting to wanting to solve problems using
computers. While taking a step back and thinking of how it would be done
without, often exposes a simpler model. Sometimes you will realize that
you don&rsquo;t need a computer at all. If not that, you get to steal from
models that have been molded and battle tested for years.</p>
<p>Look at existing organizational structures and search for boundaries.
You might find that aligning your software with existing boundaries
makes the pieces of the puzzle fit. Learn how departments communicate;
passing forms, by phone or by email. Maybe it shows that you need
synchronous communication with strong consistency based on a formal
protocol or that you might just get away with asynchronous communication
with a less strong schema. Go through paper work, formulas, legislation,
research papers, books and what not, and that hard to crack nut might
become a bit softer. Look at where people are making decisions and how
they are deciding on them, do you spot the patterns?</p>
<p>People have been solving problems for hundreds of years, tinkering with
and perfecting models, way before computers were a commodity. Natural
selection made sure only the strongest made it this far. Those solutions
didn&rsquo;t stop working all of a sudden, nor should they be discarded as a
whole. A great deal of them will likely survive another few hundred
years, in one form or the other.</p>
