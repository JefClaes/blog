<p>Being such a young conference, I had no idea what to expect. Turns out they have a good thing going on; a small, local and very personal approach to conferences. Speakers both local and international,
covering topics that serve the community, not their employer.</p>
<p>Together with Tom, I preached <a href="https://twitter.com/ziobrando">Alberto</a>&lsquo;s
Event Storming during a four hour long workshop. As always, people were
impressed by how quick you can gain an understanding of a new domain
using this technique. Slides of this workshop will be online after I
make some tweaks, and try it in Paris on Friday.</p>
<p>In my second talk, I got to share what I&rsquo;ve learned these last two years
on event sourcing. You can find the slides of that talk on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jclaes/what-if-we-stored-events-instead-of-state">Slideshare</a>.
