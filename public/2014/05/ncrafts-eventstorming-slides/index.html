				<p>Me and <a href="https://twitter.com/tojans">Tom</a> just finished doing our Event
storming workshop at <a href="http://ncrafts.io/">NCrafts Paris</a>. Although we
made a few mistakes along the way, feedback on the workshop was great. I
hope to put something out about what we learned facilitating later this
week. People talked, discovered and eventually learned a new domain in
under two hours. The domain? Two minutes before the workshop we found a
domain expert prepared to talk about his coupon start-up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modeling a business process is often associated with people in suits
having long and dull meetings. Way too much time gets wasted for an
outcome that&rsquo;s far from reality and which will be obsolete in weeks.
Event storming is a workshop format that brings modeling back to all
stakeholders, and aims to create usable models.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this workshop, you won&rsquo;t be writing any code, but you will be using
lots of paper, post-its and a marker. After going over a bit of theory
and a small example, we will present you with a real business problem,
and in a few short playful sessions you will experience how powerful
event storming can be in helping a team gain insight into complex
problems.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The techniques you will learn in this workshop will pay off
immediately. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The slides I used are now up on
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jclaes/ncrafts-eventstorming-workshop">Slideshare</a>
and embedded below.</p>
<p>To learn more, you can join the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/113258571348605620818">EventStormers
community</a>,
but more importantly, you should start experimenting yourself!</p>
