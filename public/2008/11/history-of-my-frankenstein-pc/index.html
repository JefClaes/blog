				<p>This week I decided to buy a new PC, because my old one was randomly
rebooting, was really out-of-date and because I deserved it.</p>
<p>My old PC had turned into a Frankenstein PC over the years, that&rsquo;s why I
decided to write a little summary of the modifications I did to it over
the years.</p>

<li>My new PC only had a 40GB hard drive, which wasn&rsquo;t that big of a
problem at first. I didn&rsquo;t have internet at the time! But once my
parents got me a broadband internet connection, I was running out of
space pretty fast. So I bought a new 200GB hard drive.</li>
<li>After installing my new hard drive, I started monitoring my hard
drive&rsquo;s health and came to the conclusion that the hard drives were
producing too much heat, so I added the fans. I had to cut a piece
out of my case, to give the fans some fresh air.</li>
<li>After a year, it was time to add some RAM, so I added 256MB of RAM,
which gave me a whooping 0.5GB of RAM!</li>
<li>At the time I started playing Counterstrike 1.6 with my
schoolbuddies and my VGA couldn&rsquo;t get a stable 100FPS when standing
in a smoke grenade, so I bought a new VGA from a friend.</li>
<li>Now that I added the extra RAM and a new VGA, my PC wasn&rsquo;t stable
anymore when gaming, so I needed to add some fans. Fan number 5 was
supposed to suck some fresh air into the case.</li>
<li>And fan number 6 was there to keep the VGA cool(er).</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m in love with my new PC . I&rsquo;m not into hardware, so I asked a friend
of mine who works in the local PC store to make an offer.</p>
<p>He came up with a pretty awesome configuration for the price of €666
(number of the beast obv):</p>
<ol>
<li>Motherboard: G112 GIGABYTE GA-MA770-DS3 AMD AM2+ ATX DDR2 1066 S/GBL</li>
<li>CPU: AMD PHENOM AM2+ QUAD CORE X4 9850 2.5GHZ 4MB BOX</li>
<li>RAM: 2x DDR2 APACER 2GB PC6400/800 LFT CL5.0</li>
<li>VGA: G44 GIGABYTE GF 9600 GT 512MB GDDR3 PCI-E TV-O/DUAL DVI SP</li>
<li>Harddrive: 500GB Sata</li>
</ol>
<p>I now have my new PC for two days, and it is really awesome. I wasn&rsquo;t
used to be able to play cool games anymore and forgot how much fun they
can be. I installed GTR Evolutions (I&rsquo;m a huge fan of race sims) and I
installed Far Cry 2. I&rsquo;m able to play Farcry 2 at high quality and the
graphics and the gameplay are just amazing.</p>
<p>If there are other cools games I should play please let me know.</p>
