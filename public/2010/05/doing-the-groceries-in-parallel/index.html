Programming: Understanding and Applying Parallel Patterns with the .NET

<p>There is a section in this whitepaper which explains perfectly why
parallel programming was and still is such an interesting problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider an analogy: shopping with some friends at a grocery store.
You come into the store with a grocery list, and you rip the list into
one piece per friend, such that every friend is responsible for
retrieving the elements on his or her list. If the amount of time
required to retrieve the elements on each list is approximately the
same as on every other list, you’ve done a good job of partitioning
the work amongst your team, and will likely find that your time at the
store is significantly less than if you had done all of the shopping
yourself. But now suppose that each list is not well balanced, with
all of the items on one friend’s list spread out over the entire
store, while all of the items on another friend’s list are
concentrated in the same aisle. You could address this inequity by
assigning out one element at a time. Every time a friend retrieves a
food item, he or she brings it back to you at the front of the store
and determines in conjunction with you which food item to retrieve
next. If a particular food item takes a particularly long time to
retrieve, such as ordering a custom cut piece of meat at the deli
counter, the overhead of having to go back and forth between you and
the merchandise may be negligible. For simply retrieving a can from a
shelf, however, the overhead of those trips can be dominant,
especially if multiple items to be retrieved from a shelf were near
each other and could have all been retrieved in the same trip with
minimal additional time. You could spend so much time (relatively)
parceling out work to your friends and determining what each should
buy next that it would be faster for you to just grab all of the food
items in your list yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, we don’t need to pick one extreme or the other. There are
dozens of variations on these two extremes. Think about how hard it must
be to come up with an algorithm which always takes the most efficient
path for any given scenario.</p>
<p>Food for thought..</p>
