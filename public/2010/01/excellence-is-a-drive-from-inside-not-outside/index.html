				<p>A little story I found which I think relates to software development in

<blockquote>
<p>A tourist once visited a temple under construction where he saw a
sculptor making an idol of God. Suddenly he noticed a similar idol
lying nearby. Surprised, he asked the sculptor, &ldquo;Do you need two
statues of the same idol?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the sculptor without looking up,
&ldquo;We need only one, but the first one got damaged at the last stage.&rdquo;
The gentleman examined the idol and found no apparent damage. &ldquo;Where
is the damage?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;There is a scratch on the nose of the
idol.&rdquo; said the sculptor, still busy with his work. &ldquo;Where are you
going to install the idol?&rdquo; The sculptor replied that it would be
installed on a pillar twenty feet high. &ldquo;If the idol is that far, who
is going to know that there is a scratch on the nose?&rdquo; the gentleman
asked. The sculptor stopped his work, looked up at the gentleman,
smiled and said, &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will know
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we apply this whole story to software development? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Often we need to ship the product
without it being perfect. Something we can learn from this story is that
although the customer does not care about continuous integration, best
practices,.. we as developers do should care about everything that isn&rsquo;t
visible to the customer.</p>
