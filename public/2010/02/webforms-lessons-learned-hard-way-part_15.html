<p>ASP.NET Webforms has a lot of good stuff built into it. Do your homework
before you start building the next big Webforms thing! A perfect example
of this is ASP.NET Membership. ASP.NET provides an out-of-box membership
solution. I&rsquo;ve seen people who were to lazy to do some research or
thought they could do better and ended up with a solution which put its
doors wide open to people with bad intentions.</p>
<p>When a feature doesn&rsquo;t exactly match your needs, try extending it. The
ASP.NET team are artists as it comes to writing solid extensible frameworks. I&rsquo;d like to point to ASP.NET Membership again. You can write
your <a href="http://www.asp.net/(S(ywiyuluxr3qb2dfva1z5lgeg))/learn/videos/video-189.aspx">own provider</a> which integrates with ASP.NET seamlessly.</p>
<h3 id="move-as-much-as-possible-away-from-your-page">Move as much as possible away from your page</h3>
<p>Separating the domain and persistence away from your presentation logic positively affects the quality of your page and code-behind in so many ways.</p>
<p>One of the big drawbacks of Webforms is that testing your pages isn&rsquo;t
easy. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to keep the quantity of code in the
code-behind as low as possible. Code outside your presentation logic can
easily be covered using unittests.</p>
<p>Dividing your web application in multiple layers also makes the code in
the page and page-behind easier to grasp (encapsulation etc..).</p>
<h3 id="let-others-do-it-for-you">Let others do it for you</h3>
<p>Because most of the ASP.NET Server controls are easy to extend, there a
lot of third party control vendors out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only been using the <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx">Telerik RadControls</a> for a few months now, and using this control suite, made my life so much easier.1000$ might look like a big investment, but you can&rsquo;t believe how many time it has saved me. Especially the <a href="http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/grid/examples/performance/linq/defaultcs.aspx">RadGrid</a>
control is a great time-saver. Binding a list of objects to a RadGrid,
and finding out sorting, paging,.. just works is awesome.</p>
<p>What are some of your Webforms lessons learned the hard way?</p>
