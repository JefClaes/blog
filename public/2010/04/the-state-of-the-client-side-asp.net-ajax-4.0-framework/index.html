				<p>The people who follow my blog might remember the <a href="http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/01/wrapping-up-an-introduction-to-aspnet.html">ASP.NET Ajax 4.0
series</a>.
In these series I showed some of the core features of the ASP.NET Ajax
4.0 beta javascript library.</p>
<p>In January Microsoft told us that they would ship the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0
library as a part of the Microsoft Ajax framework, together with the
release of ASP.NET 4.0. A few days ago I was ready to dig in the library
a little deeper, but I found out that most of the documentation and
resources I used to consult, had moved or had disappeared.</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://twitter.com/JefClaes">follow me on Twitter</a> you might
have seen me ranting about this. <a href="http://twitter.com/LeeDumond">Lee
Dumond</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/one75">Stijn
Volders</a> told me that the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0
library now is a part of the Ajax Controltoolkit and that it&rsquo;s
deprecated.</p>
<p>I contacted Dave Reed
(<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/">InfinitiesLoop</a>) for some more
clarity on this subject and he told me this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scripts aren&rsquo;t going away, but we aren&rsquo;t investing in them
anymore, instead we are looking at how we can extend jQuery to meet
the same needs. We are folding those scripts into the
AjaxControlToolkit (on
<a href="http://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/">ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com</a>
&ndash; ajax.codeplex.com is no longer), so you can still get them from
there, and even contribute to them if you would like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dave also pointed me to a <a href="http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2010/03/16/microsoft-jquery-and-templating.aspx">post on Stephen Walther&rsquo;s
blog</a>,
where this part is interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are moving the ASP.NET Ajax Library into the Ajax Control Toolkit.
If you currently use ASP.NET Ajax Library client templates, client
data-binding, or the client script loader then you can continue to use
these features by downloading the Ajax Control Toolkit.</p>
<p>Be aware that our focus with the Ajax Control Toolkit is server-side
Ajax. For client-side Ajax, we are shifting our focus to jQuery. For
example, if you have been using ASP.NET Ajax Library client templates
then we recommend that you shift to using jQuery instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the client-side ASP.NET Ajax framework is jinxed. Same as with
the previous releases of the client-side ASP.NET Ajax framework, this
release is dead before it got a chance to live. I definitely have
sympathy for Microsoft on this one though, jQuery really is that good. I
only hope that they will be able to push some of the best features of
the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 library into jQuery.</p>
