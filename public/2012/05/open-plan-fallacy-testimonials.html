				<p>I wrote an article titled &lsquo;<a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/05/open-plan-fallacy.html">The open plan
fallacy</a>&rsquo; just
two weeks ago. Earlier this week <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/science/when-buzz-at-your-cubicle-is-too-loud-for-work.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all">a similar
article</a>
was published by the New York Times. The content of that article wasn&rsquo;t
particularly extraordinary, but the comments were. I waded through all
of them on my daily commute, and it&rsquo;s really hard to find one in favor
of open plan offices - people seem to be enraged.</p>
<p>I handpicked some of the most interesting ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research by Emberson et.al. (Psychological Science, 2010) demonstrate
both the impairment in performance for people forced to listen to half
a phone conversation and the neurological impossibility of &ldquo;tuning
out&rdquo; these overheard conversations. The office experience has been
described as trying to drive a car full of people all talking on their
cell phones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s preferable to have to make the effort to collaborate than the
effort to focus on one&rsquo;s work amidst a distracting open workplace. My
profession, architecture, does require a high degree of collaboration,
but also a need for intense, individual concentration working on
complicated 3D computer models and details.. and long hours being in
&ldquo;the zone&rdquo;. My firm provides private offices for all of its staff and
a variety of collaborative and recreational environments..
particularly the latter, recognizing that just by hanging out together
for part of the day, individuals from different project teams and
pursuits &ldquo;cross-pollinate&rdquo;, come up with imaginative ideas, influence
and inspire eachother.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cubicles were invented as a way to shove more people into a smaller
space and save money for corporations. The entire meme about &ldquo;improved
workplace communications&rdquo; was invented by consultants as a
smokescreen. Period. End of story.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For example, someone whose job requires intense concentration (e.g.
computer programmer) needs absolute silence. Programmers who do not
get this silence are likely to make mistakes.&rdquo;<br>
I&rsquo;ve been around a lot of programmers, among lots of other kinds of
workers, and I&rsquo;d say that 90% of the developers I saw were in a large
room with others all around them. It&rsquo;s actually one of the least
likely jobs to provide someone with an office, despite the fact that
your diagnosis about what the job requires is absolutely right, in my
opinion.<br>
All it takes is a few months in the world of corporations to
understand that Dilbert is really a documentary.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I currently work in an open plan office and absolutely hate it. Not
having an office with a door that others need to knock on before
disturbing me has led to non-stop disturbances all day long. Not to
mention having to listen to nonstop chatter of those around me. It is
an incredibly inefficient - and I may add, unprofessional - way to
work. Any money saved on rent is surely made up for in lost
productivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that the person who decides on the open cube layout
usually sits in an office.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Having participated in the design of office environments, where we
used low cubicle walls or even no walls to support certain kinds of
collaborative work, with the full involvement of the employees in that
design, it was always distressing to see the &lsquo;open office&rsquo; faddishly
embraced by management everywhere, regardless of actual practices
required for the work. Consultancies, as usual, led the way in yet
another blind embrace of &lsquo;innovation&rsquo;.<br>
Why would individual &lsquo;entrepreneurs&rsquo; - to take one example from this
story - want or need to be able to see and hear each other whilst
working? Are the activities in which they are engaged intimately
linked, are the tasks often (and necessarily) performed conjointly, is
their own working division of labour a concerted one? What do these
entrepreneurs themselves think about such matters? (Well, as the story
makes plain, they have very clear answers, voting with their
headphones!) Anyway, these are the kinds of very practical questions
about work activities and worker needs that should drive office
design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my article, I advocated isolating teams instead of individuals, but
most commenters seem to be heavy supporters of private offices -
including walls and a door. I never experienced that in a professional
environment, so I couldn&rsquo;t say if that would work for software
development. Can you? Collaboration and communication between developers
is a necessity. Fostering that just seems hard when everyone is in a
separate place - definitely for young teams. While comparing office
layouts, I wondered how my proposed solution would scale; how many
people can you put in one team before you encounter the same undesired
open plan side-effects?</p>
