				<p>I haven&rsquo;t worked in a whole lot of places, somewhere around four, but
every single one of them used an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_plan">open
plan</a> to structure their
workplace. From what I hear from others, it&rsquo;s the standard.</p>
<p>There are a few things to say about the advantages of an open office
layout. They should stimulate communication, create more opportunities
for observing and learning from others and be more cost-effective. I&rsquo;m
afraid it&rsquo;s the latter which is the biggest driver though.</p>
<p>In reality open plans really aren&rsquo;t all that great. The noise alone has
proven to reduce productivity by <em>one third</em>. When I look around, I see
plenty of signs that people have a hard time getting their job done:
programmers buying $500 noise-cancelling headphones in an attempt to
keep the environmental noise out, project managers camping in free
meeting rooms trying to focus on their number wizardry or even whole
teams occupying a meeting room days before a release.</p>
<p>What bothers me the most is overhearing other teams, those distractions
amount to nothing at all. What&rsquo;s the value of me overhearing a
discussion on some obscure Sharepoint problem? None. What are the
benefits of listening to your team&rsquo;s Friday after lunch bullshitting?
Nothing. Team dynamics differ, that&rsquo;s normal, but they shouldn&rsquo;t disturb
others.</p>
<p>The extreme alternative would be private offices, but I&rsquo;m pretty
confident that&rsquo;s far from perfect as well.</p>
<p>What I suggest, is installing each team in their own fully isolated
area, free from distractions caused by other teams. This would still do
right to all the advantages of an open plan, while taking away some of
its biggest bottlenecks. By installing each team in their own cocoon,
you create an environment where overhearing conversations on the next
feature is an added value, where you can quickly short-circuit
discussions on an architectural decision or where you might even
concentrate on a problem for 45 minutes straight. The only advantage
which is partially gone is cost-effectiveness; there needs to be some
flexible infrastructure in place, that makes it easy to swiftly adapt
the environment when team compositions change.</p>
<p>Instead of always focusing on that short term budget win, we need to
start paying attention to the big picture again: offices should enable
teams, not sabotage them.</p>
<p><em>Is there anybody who genuinely loves open plan offices? If not, what
alternative would you prefer?</em></p>
