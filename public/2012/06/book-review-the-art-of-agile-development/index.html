				<p>While I have - obviously - read the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile
Manifesto</a> before, and regularly click
through to articles on agile, I had never read an extensive work on it.
Browsing for a good book, I was advised by a peer to get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596527675/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diofanedebyje-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596527675">The Art of
Agile
Development</a>.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly believe in the Agile Manifesto, but somewhere along the
way Agile - with a capital A - got somewhat of a bad rep. The authors of
this book, <a href="http://jamesshore.com/">James Shore</a> and Shane Warden,
already predicted this five years ago. Throughout the book, I never had
the feeling they were connected to the Agile mob, but just genuinely
care about working software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I fully expect the big consulting companies to start offering
Certified Agile Processes and Certified Agile Consultants - for
astronomical fees, of course - any day now. <strong>Please don&rsquo;t get sucked
into that mess.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book consists of three parts: getting started, practicing XP and
mastering agility. Notice the title of the second part, this is a book
on agile development using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme
Programming</a>
methodology. This should be mentioned in the title.<br>
The second part is also the dominant chunk of the book - 271 pages to be
precise -, in which 37 agile development practices are covered. These
practices are bundled into five categories: thinking, collaborating,
releasing, planning and developing. Each practice follows the same
recipe: breakdown, questions, results, contraindications, alternatives
and further reading. These recipes go into detail, making this book
suitable as a reference. As a result, it often also reads as reference
material; I found it hard at times to stay attentive. The material is a
bit tedious, sometimes a bit repetitive, and while some of the real
world experiences are very interesting, the made up stories often read
as a children&rsquo;s book. Nonetheless, this doesn&rsquo;t make the information in
this book any less valuable. The authors have lived it through and
through, and possess a very healthy and pragmatic vision on agile
software development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately what matters is success, however you define it. The
practices, principles, and values are merely guides along the way.
 Start by following the practices rigorously. Learn what the the
principles mean. Break the rules, experiment, see what works, and
learn some more. Share your insights and passion, and learn even more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I rate this book 4/5. You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596527675/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diofanedebyje-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596527675">get it on
Amazon</a>.</p>
