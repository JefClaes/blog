				<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again where I take some time to look back on
the year passed and peek at the year ahead. This is mostly a post I like
to write up for myself, forcing reflection.</p>
<p>The biggest personal changes this year were moving out of my parents&rsquo;
place, and my girlfriend&rsquo;s decision to study medicine after graduating
as a Master of Arts earlier this year. I had no idea how things would
turn out once we lived together, but so far we have been doing great.</p>
<h3 id="my-career">My career</h3>
<p>September marked one year working for
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/euricom?trk=hb_tab_compy_id_30393/">Euricom</a>.
I&rsquo;m still at my first client, and while I definitely regularly have my
share of the enterprise blues, I also learned a lot working on several
projects: from maintaining legacy to leading green fields. Fairly, I
often doubt if traditional enterprise life is <em>it</em> for me though.</p>
<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>
<p>I published 66 posts this year, which seems to be consistent with
previous years.</p>
<p>While writing has turned into a habit over the years, I often struggle
with deciding what I should write about. Any reason is probably a good
one though; documenting, sharing opinions and experiences, or just
writing for the sake of writing&hellip; But I still feel like I should add
value and contribute something worthwhile when I spend time on this
blog.</p>
<p>The topics haven&rsquo;t changed that much this year. I still write often on
Web technologies (ASP.NET, NancyFx and REST) - something I didn&rsquo;t get to
spend much time on at work this year, but I also wrote about
architecture, testing and NoSQL. Next to those topics, I also penned
some of my experiences gained doing experimental side projects.<br>
In 2013, I intent to get more out of my comfort zone, and to also write
down thoughts which are not that strongly held.</p>
<p>Page views have more than doubled (173k) compared to 2011, which I&rsquo;m
humbled by, but I seem to care less about that than a little while ago.
It had even been over a month since I logged into Google Analytics.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2012-12-31-2012-annual-review-traffic.PNG"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2012-12-31-2012-annual-review-traffic.PNG" alt=""></a></p>
<h3 id="community">Community</h3>
<p>It very much depends on what I&rsquo;m doing that day, but I still spend
quite some time on <a href="http://twitter.com/JefClaes">Twitter</a>. I often blurt
out thoughts on software, and regularly, someone who knows better than
me replies, and challenges my looks on software. That&rsquo;s how I get value
out of Twitter. That, and animated GIFs of course.</p>
<p>In real life, I went to see a few interesting speakers at local user
groups, and <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/10/slides-and-code-from-my-webnet-europe.html">gave a talk myself at Web.NET Europe
Milan</a> - international speaker, wooh. I want to applaud the organization of Web.NET Europe once more; <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/10/post-webnet-europe.html">they did a great
job</a>.</p>
<p>In general, I started to value artificial sponsored user groups less.
They have their place, and they do add value, but it&rsquo;s not something
that I feel I need to be a part of. Having some beers with a few
likeminded developers suits me better.</p>
<h3 id="travelling">Travelling</h3>
<p>Buying an apartment and all of that, we didn&rsquo;t get to make any epic
travels this year. I got to visit three different countries though:
<a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/07/finito.html">Italy</a>,
<a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/09/slides-and-code-from-my-tunisia-rest.html">Tunisia</a>,
<a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/10/slides-and-code-from-my-webnet-europe.html">Italy again</a>,
and <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/10/cote-dopale.html">France</a>. Two out
of four were sponsored by my job; not bad.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re setting out for a big trip again in 2013. <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/once-upon-time-in-west.html">We fell in love with
America two years
ago</a>, so
we&rsquo;ve been researching the South-West again - but closer to the Mexican
border this time. Other destinations are still open for discussion
though.</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>I spent a considerate part of 2012 <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/building-small-things.html">building small things on the
side</a>. This
didn&rsquo;t result in anything useful, but most importantly, it got me in the
habit of working on my own things, and I put together a toolset which
enables me to ship things fast (NancyFx, Twitter Bootstrap, MongoDB,
AppHarbor, &hellip;).</p>
<p>The first project I did in 2012 was Docary. This was supposed to be
something between a timesheet and a diary. This idea quickly died after
I couldn&rsquo;t commit to using it myself. Technically I played with <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/11/programming-for-future-of-mobile.html">early
versions of jQuery
mobile</a>
and EF, and learned why you shouldn&rsquo;t overlayer your MVC application -
or any web application for the matter.</p>
<p>For the second project, I and <a href="https://twitter.com/davybrion">Davy
Brion</a> worked on
<a href="https://github.com/JefClaes/topdevlinks">TopDevLinks</a>. This was
supposed to be a linkblog implementation on top of ASP.NET MVC,
<a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/10/commands-queries-and-testing.html">CQS</a>
and MongoDB. We both lost interest in the concept eventually.</p>
<p>I made my girlfriend a <a href="https://github.com/JefClaes/kristienbehets-portfolio">petite portfolio
site</a> built on top
of NancyFx, the FlickR API, and some jQuery plug-ins. Right now, it&rsquo;s
actually <a href="http://kristienbehets.be/">running as a static site on GitHub
pages</a> though.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/11/released-kill-long-meetings.html">I already blogged about the next
project</a>:
Kill Long Meetings. This one is still around, but quickly floundered
into forgetfulness after its five minutes of Twitter fame.</p>
<p>Now that I look back at it, I did write quite some code after my hours
this year&hellip; Next to being in the moment of building and shipping stuff,
I genuinely believe it makes me better at my job.</p>
<p>I hope to be able to do as much in 2013, but to also let it be something
worthwhile. I&rsquo;ll be actually already shipping something new in a few
weeks if all goes well.</p>
<h3 id="sporthealth">Sport/Health</h3>
<p>The biggest gift I gave myself health wise this year, was giving up on
smoking; I lit my last one over six months ago!</p>
<p>Moving to Antwerp, and not having any area to put my weights, I&rsquo;ve
joined a gym again, where I&rsquo;m doing a two times a week compound routine.
That should make me stronger again; I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of beef since
picking up running three years ago.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t given up on running - living close to the city park helps. I
just missed the 1000km (or 621 miles) milestone this year, which is kind
of lame, but I&rsquo;m far from complaining.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2012-12-31-2012-annual-review-nikerunning.PNG"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2012-12-31-2012-annual-review-nikerunning.PNG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I hope for in this area in 2013. It&rsquo;s starting to dawn
on me that, even though those goals I set for myself have pushed me
further than I thought I was capable of - I couldn&rsquo;t jog 1km without a
break three years ago, they are not that important. It eventually comes
down to nourishing your body, and making use of it in every way possible
while you can.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Earlier this week, I strolled down the main street of Brussels and
crossed a beggar with one leg and no arms. Next to feeling extremely
sorry for that man, I felt truly blessed; I&rsquo;m healthy, loved, have more
than I need, and I get to do what I like for a living. I need to remind
myself more of that in 2013 - I can be a whiny bitch.</p>
<p>I plan to keep course in 2013, but as a better man.</p>
<p>How was your year? What do you plan for in 2013?</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;m going to help a hand in preparing the
festivities before the girlfriend really gets in a faul mood.</p>
<p>*Holy crap, when I sat down to write this, I didn&rsquo;t expect to write a
whole book. I&rsquo;m wondering how many people actually made it down here. *</p>
