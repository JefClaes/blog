				<p>Maybe the writing has been on the wall for Feedburner for a long time.
No features were added for over four years, no bugs were fixed, the
look-and-feel wasn&rsquo;t updated to be consistent with other Google
products, support channels were being shut down,&hellip; But it wasn&rsquo;t until
last Friday that the degradation of the service really got tangible: all
subscriber counts indicated zero. Dozens of people complained, using all
possible communication channels, but nobody listened.</p>
<p>When I set up this blog almost five years ago, I made the mistake of
pointing people to a naked Feedburner url, which now forces me to ask my
subscribers to resubscribe. I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson, and I&rsquo;ve set up a
more sustainable url: <a href="http://feed.jefclaes.be/jefclaes">http://feed.jefclaes.be/jefclaes</a>.</p>
<p>I always valued RSS subscribers more than people coming from search
engines; it encourages me to know there are people curious for more
content. So if you&rsquo;re reading this, please unsubscribe from this feed,
and resubscribe to <a href="http://feed.jefclaes.be/jefclaes">http://feed.jefclaes.be/jefclaes</a>, the current feed
will phase out over the next thirty days.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Feedburner is dead. I messed up by pointing you there. Please
resubscribe to <a href="http://feed.jefclaes.be/jefclaes">http://feed.jefclaes.be/jefclaes</a>.</strong></p>
