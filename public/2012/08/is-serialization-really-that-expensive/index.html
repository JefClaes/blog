				<p>While wading through an exotic codebase, I stumbled upon a static class
named Convert. This class contained somewhere around 2700
(non-generated) lines of code, where each method manually converted some
object to a simple textual representation. These methods were then used
to convert requests and reponses to and from a remote third party
service before logging them to the database for auditing reasons.</p>
<pre><code>public static class Convert
{
    public static string PaymentRequest(PaymentRequest req)
    {
        var sb = new StringBuilder();

        sb.Append(&quot;Reference: &quot; + req.Reference + &quot; - &quot;);
        sb.Append(&quot;NumberOfLicenses: &quot; + req.NumberOfLicenses + &quot; - &quot;);
        sb.Append(&quot;PricePerLicense: &quot; + req.PricePerLicense + &quot; - &quot;);
        sb.Append(&quot;CardNumber: &quot; + req.CardNumber + &quot; - &quot;);
        sb.Append(&quot;Address: &quot; + req.Address);

        return sb.ToString();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>My first thoughts were something along of the lines of &ldquo;What the.. this
is insanely stupid code.&rdquo; This must be a PITA to maintain and be
extremely error-prone. Looking at the solution now, it looks simple
enough to move that to some infrastructure and have the conversion done
by something more generic. <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx">Serializing to
JSON</a> comes to mind;
interpretable by man ánd machine.</p>
<p>Trying not to jump to conclusions, I looked for one of the remaining
team members, and asked why they made that decision. &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, he said,
&ldquo;Those remote service calls are expensive as is; it&rsquo;s a slow connection,
we have to encrypt everything going over the wire, and we can&rsquo;t make
them asynchronously. We optimized where we could. Including logging.&rdquo;<br>
I asked if they found serialization to be so expensive that it could
warrant all the monkey code. He said yes, but that he couldn&rsquo;t vouch for
the decision since <em>they never measured</em>.</p>
<p>Later that day, I took five minutes to see how the two really compare. I
have <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1047218/benchmarking-small-code-samples-in-c-can-this-implementation-be-improved">this code
snippet</a>
lying around if I quickly want to profile something.</p>
<pre><code>static void Profile(string description, int iterations, Action func)
{
    // clean up
    GC.Collect();
    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
    GC.Collect();

    // warm up 
    func();

    var watch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; iterations; i++)    
        func();    
    watch.Stop();
    
    Console.Write(description);
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Time Elapsed {0} ms&quot;, watch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
}
</code></pre>
<p>I picked an average sized object graph and ran the benchmark.</p>
<pre><code>var req = new PaymentRequest()
{
    Reference = &quot;ABC123&quot;,
    NumberOfLicenses = 3,
    PricePerLicense = 15.99,
    CardNumber = &quot;123456&quot;,
    Address = &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;
};

Profile(&quot;Serializing a request.&quot;, 1, () =&gt; Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(req));
Profile(&quot;Doing it manually.&quot;, 1, () =&gt; Convert.PaymentRequest(req));
</code></pre>
<p>This yielded following results.</p>
<pre><code>Serializing a request. Time Elapsed 0 ms
Doing it manually. Time Elapsed 0 ms
</code></pre>
<p>Neglectable.</p>
<p>Turning up the number of iterations to 100 produces following results.</p>
<pre><code>Serializing a request. Time Elapsed 9 ms
Doing it manually. Time Elapsed 1 ms
</code></pre>
<p>This time around, we see a huge relative difference; doing it manually
is 9 times as fast. The absolute difference is still neglectable
though.</p>
<p>As it turns out, for this specific scenario, with <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx">this specific
serialization
library</a>, the
overhead of serialization would be very tolerable. Other serialization
libraries might produce <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bZNx64Vindc/UDS-q5630JI/AAAAAAAABYk/DeNUYA9ARMs/s611/jsonperformance.png">less tolerable
results</a> though.
It&rsquo;s important to measure this stuff; I&rsquo;m (re)learning almost daily
that* assuming is a mistake*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Measurement is the first step that leads to control and eventually to
improvement. If you can&rsquo;t measure something, you can&rsquo;t understand it.
If you can&rsquo;t understand it, you can&rsquo;t control it. If you can&rsquo;t control
it, you can&rsquo;t improve it. - H. James Harrington</p>
