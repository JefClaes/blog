				<p>I have picked up a few new tools this summer
(<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, <a href="http://nancyfx.org/">NancyFx</a> and
<a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">WebAPI</a>), and it occurred to me that I&rsquo;ve
built certain habits these last few years in how I make use of all the
learning resources out there.<br>
I tried to identify all of them, to then categorize them, to finally
order them according to in which phase of my study process I use them.</p>
<p><strong>The written and spoken word</strong></p>
<p>The first thing I look for online is documentation. It might be a
coincidence, but all the documentation I found for these three tools was
excellent. It seems obvious, now more than ever, that the early
adaptation of new tools can be proportional to the quality of their
documentation.</p>
<p>When there is no documentation - studying a concept instead of a
technology, when the documentation is too dispersed, or when the quality
is too low, I might order a book. The problem with technical books
though, is that they are often too lengthy. I think the first publisher
that cuts down on the number of pages, while guarding quality, will be
pleasantly surprised by demand. I really like <a href="http://openmymind.net/2011/3/28/The-Little-MongoDB-Book/">the &ldquo;Little book&rdquo;
format</a> <a href="http://openmymind.net/">Karl
Seguin</a> has been experimenting with.</p>
<p>When there is no documentation, and there are no books, I find myself
turning to the spoken word. In general, I prefer reading over watching
and listening because I can do that at my own pace, skip chapters, or
quickly skim back for a look-up.<br>
Although often on the slow side, the videocasts from Pluralsight are not
bad. If you don&rsquo;t want to subscribe to one of the paid videocast
services, you can also watch recorded conference sessions instead.
Before I commuted by train, I also listened to relevant podcasts.</p>
<p><strong>Getting intimate</strong></p>
<p>As I wrote earlier, <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/03/learning-hacker-way.html">I am a strong advocate of learning by
doing</a>. Find
<a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/building-small-things.html">something
small</a>, and
build it.<br>
When I&rsquo;m using a new tool, I also tend to regularly peek at its
internals to improve my understanding of how the tool works under the
covers. It&rsquo;s never a bad idea to get intimate with the tools you rely
on.<br>
This becomes extremely easy when the tool you are using is OSS and uses
a source control provider that makes it easy to browse or fork the
source - read GitHub. If the tool isn&rsquo;t OSS, you can still decompile the
sources using one of the free decompilation options out there. If you
have a Resharper 6 license, you can even decompile straight from Visual
Studio.</p>
<p><strong>Sipping from the fire hose</strong></p>
<p>Once I start building something, I crank open the fire hose - Twitter
Search, and take a sip. Although trying to consume all the information
on a subject is hardly bearable, and feels as being waterboarded at
times, I think it&rsquo;s a necessary evil. Until you have assembled your
personal digest, that is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep up with the Twitter Search feed for a while, and
try to filter knowledgeable people to follow, blogs to subscribe to, and
repositories to watch. Once I have a qualitative list of subscriptions,
I&rsquo;ll shut off the fire hose, and limit my consummation to my personal
high quality-to-noise digest. This digest will serve as one of the
biggest aids in continuously improving my knowledge of said tool.</p>
<p><strong>Free pop quizzes</strong></p>
<p>I always thought that if you really want to become good at something -
become an expert, you must have spent time in the trenches, knees deep
in shit. Experiences like this force you to broaden your understanding
of a technology.<br>
Next to problems you encounter producing things, you can also simulate
this experience by following <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>
questions and commit to help solving them. The less ambitious can also
wait a while, and just skim over the questions and their answers. The
same goes for mailing lists obviously.</p>
<p>*I&rsquo;m very curious to hear about the techniques you use to unravel all
the information out there.Â *</p>
