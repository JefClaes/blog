				<p>The girlfriend, me and another couple, returned from a short weekend at
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_d'Opale">French Opal Coast</a>
yesterday evening. Although we only planned this trip a  week in
advance, we still failed to anticipate how erratic the weather can be in
October; setting up camp in the dark, on a sloughy underground, with a
soft drizzle on your back, isn&rsquo;t my idea of fun after a long day at
work. The next morning, with destination <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_Blanc_Nez">Cape Blanc
Nez</a>, we drove over coastal
routes between vast green fields, towards clearer skies. Passing white
cliffs of clay and untouched beaches, we eventually halted at the
obelisk commemorating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover_Patrol">Dover
Patrol</a> for a while. Here you
can clearly see the English coast on the other side of the canal; no
wonder this spot was strategically ideal to safeguard the canal during
World War I. Differing from the main route, we discovered the ramshackle
remainder of a bunker. I think it&rsquo;s fascinating how quickly something
what once played an important role in our history, can lose its
prestige, and be seen for what it is: a massive block of concrete.</p>
<p>I honestly was taken aback by the beauty of the Northern French coast. I
had always unjustifiably ignored this area, and now I will definitely
have to revisit.</p>
<p>Sunday, before leaving, we visited a local
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bric-%C3%A0-brac">bric-à-brac</a>. Just
before returning to the car, my girlfriend spotted an antique camera
satchel, which she thought would make a unique accessory - you know how
girls are, right? The woman behind the stand wouldn&rsquo;t let it go without
the camera though, and asked too much for both, so we strolled on.
Passing the same spot a few minutes later, she inquired how much we
wanted to give her for it. Mistakenly, my girlfriend said <em>dix-cinq</em>
(ten five) instead of using the more correct <em>quinze</em> (fifteen). The
woman understood this as <em>dis cinq</em> (how about five), and doubled it to
ten. Sold! And that&rsquo;s how my girlfriend saved herself five euros without
even having to haggle.</p>

<p>Thanks to our companion Lars Oliviers for letting me put his pictures in
this post.</p>
