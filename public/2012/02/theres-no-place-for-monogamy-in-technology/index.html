				<p>In this post I would like to share some of my thoughts on a <a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/128.html">recent post
by James Hague</a> titled &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Fall in
Love With Your Technology&rsquo;. If you haven&rsquo;t read that post yet, please

<p>I think there is nothing wrong with falling in love with your technology
per se. If you want to have a fair relationship with your technology,
you have to invest in her. Don&rsquo;t have a superficial relationship, take
her home with you, spend some cosy Sunday afternoons together. Get to
know her inside out. Know when it&rsquo;s fun to be with her, but also more
importantly when it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The problem with falling in love with your technology is that a lot of
us fall blindly in love. Please don&rsquo;t. Be unfaithful, do - at least -
look at other technologies. Take them out on a crazy Friday night date.
In the meanwhile you might discover that that new technology does a few
things better than the current one and that she&rsquo;s a lot more fun.</p>
<p>I guarantee that what now seems like the love of your life, will one day
be nothing more than a long forgotten memory which might bring a smirk
on your face on remembering her, but there will be no regret in leaving
her.</p>
