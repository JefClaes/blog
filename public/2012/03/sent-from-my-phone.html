				<p>According to <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2500-lets-be-honest-sent-from-my">Matt from
37signals</a>
the line &ldquo;Sent from my iPhone&rdquo; at the bottom of an email means this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s be honest. “Sent from my iPhone” really means “I’m not going to
bother to proofread and correct this because it would take me an extra
30 seconds.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree. I too use this line as an excuse to write a terse message and
omit proper salutations.</p>
<p>However, I also think these four simple words greatly helped the viral
growth of the mobile phone. Having early adopters brag about how they&rsquo;re
sending emails from their fancy new phone must have been an invaluable
form of word-of-mouth advertising.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that those four words first are a marketing
technique and then a convenient way of letting your correspondents know
that there might be a typo in your message. If not, the default line
wouldn&rsquo;t include the brand name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m turning this thing into a rambling though. What I really wanted to
share is a snippet of the <em>much recommended</em> book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diofanedebyje-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307887898%22">The Lean
Startup</a>,
where <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">Eric Ries</a> shares a story
on how Hotmail used a similar technique in 1996 to fuel their viral
engine of growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But everything changed when they made one small tweak to the product.
They added to the bottom of every e-mail the message &ldquo;P.S. Get your
free e-mail at Hotmail&rdquo; along with a clickable link.<br>
Within weeks, that small product change produced massive results.
Within six months, Bhatia and Smith had signed up more than 1 million
new customers. Five weeks later, they hit the 2 million mark. Eighteen
months after launching the service, with 12 million subscribers, they
sold the company to Microsoft for $400 million.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it incredibly intriguing how a few words can have such an impact.
Maybe you do too.</p>
