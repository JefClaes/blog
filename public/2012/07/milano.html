<p>Since the days of our dolce vita are numbered, we made our last big trip
today: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan">Milano</a>. We parked our car
in the suburbs, where you pay only a quarter an hour and have a direct
metro-connection to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duomo">Duomo</a>.
While we&rsquo;ve had it with churches in general, we couldn&rsquo;t let this one
slip. The Milanese Duomo is the third biggest church in all of
Christendom and could easily host a Metallica concert. The entrance to
the church is free, but if you want to visit the rooftop, you pay 7€ on
foot (250 stairs) or 12€ if you want to take the elevator. Although the
panorama wasn&rsquo;t as striking as the one we had seen yesterday, the
architecture and craftsmanship of the rooftop details are worth to see
up close. After that, we continued the &lsquo;Old City&rsquo; itinerary of our
travel guide, which includes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_Vittorio_Emanuele_II">Galleria Vittorio Emanuele
II</a> and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Scala">Teatro alla Scala</a>.</p>
