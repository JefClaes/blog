      <description>Belgian&amp;rsquo;s National Railway has decided to strike again today to assail Europe&amp;rsquo;s oncoming austerity. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is anything wrong with sticking it to the man, or fighting for your right to party, if you believe it is just, yet the preferred tactics don&amp;rsquo;t feel quite right. There must be more constructive ways to get your point across, instead of terribly inconveniencing all those people who give you a job in the first place, your customers.</description>

      <description>Last week, several news channels reported on the strongest solar storm since 2005. This news item reminded me of a peculiar support ticket we received one gray Monday morning a few years ago, when I was still writing software for fire departments.

      <title>Recursively spawning Web Workers</title>

      <description>I like to think of HTML5 Web Workers simply as &amp;lsquo;threading for the Web&amp;rsquo;.
Wikipedia describes it a bit more in detail.
 Web Workers define an API for running scripts, basically JavaScript, in the background independently of any user interface scripts. This allows for long-running scripts that are not interrupted by scripts that respond to clicks or other user interactions, and allows long tasks to be executed without yielding to keep the page responsive.</description>

      <description>A Real Developer is a side-project I built over the weekend poking around with WebMatrix.

It got a little out of hand. After publishing, I showed it to a few popular tweeps, and they were kind enough to mention it. 24 hours after the launch it has gotten over 3.5k unique visitors, 39k page views (see what I did there?) and over 240 submissions. Being mentioned by Scott Hanselman and Rey Bango helps.</description>

      <title>Using C# keywords as variables</title>

      <description>Hold it, don&amp;rsquo;t shoot me. I know this would be an awful practice, but it is an interesting C# compiler quirk nonetheless.
 Keywords are predefined reserved identifiers that have special meanings to the compiler. They cannot be used as identifiers in your program unless they include @ as a prefix. For example, @if is a legal identifier but if is not because it is a keyword.
 static void Main(string[] args) { var @if = &amp;quot;oh my.</description>
