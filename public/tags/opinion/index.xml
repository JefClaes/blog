      <description>When people get paid to write software, we very often find some form of friction between the people that build the software and those that pay to have it built.
The company I joined three years ago was no exception. When I joined, they had just launched three months ago, weren&amp;rsquo;t seeing any return on investment and prospects weren&amp;rsquo;t too bright either.
I won&amp;rsquo;t lie, that first year was quite stressful.</description>

Where I used to work in the typical battery cage, I&amp;rsquo;m now part of a team of just four people, having the luxury of a big dedicated room to ourselves - a whole floor actually. The room is set up almost symmetrically; two desks on one side of the room and two more on the other side, with quite some space in between.</description>
