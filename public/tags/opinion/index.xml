      <description>When people get paid to write software, we very often find some form of friction between the people that build the software and those that pay to have it built.
The company I joined three years ago was no exception. When I joined, they had just launched three months ago, weren&amp;rsquo;t seeing any return on investment and prospects weren&amp;rsquo;t too bright either.
I won&amp;rsquo;t lie, that first year was quite stressful.</description>

      <description>This week marked my first year at my current employer. While that event went by rather silently, one year in, a few of my observations are finally shaping up to be cast into writing.
Where I used to work in the typical battery cage, I&amp;rsquo;m now part of a team of just four people, having the luxury of a big dedicated room to ourselves - a whole floor actually. The room is set up almost symmetrically; two desks on one side of the room and two more on the other side, with quite some space in between.</description>

      <description>The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi popularized the term &amp;ldquo;flow&amp;rdquo; to describe states of absorption in which attention is so narrowly focused on an activity that a sense of time fades, along with the troubles and concerns of day-to-day life. &amp;ldquo;Flow provides an escape from the chaos of the quotidian,&amp;rdquo; he wrote.  This is a snippet from the highly recommended book Addiction by Design, which not only gives you an incredibly complete overview of the gambling industry, but also insights into the human psyche which apply far outside the domain of gambling.</description>

      <description>Two junior developers who started working for the company at the same time, had been quite competitive with each other from the get-go. They had once been assigned to the same team, but because of the constant bickering, which had put a serious amount of stress on the team, one of them was pulled off the project and reassigned.
A good year later, just the two of them were assigned to a new smallish, but interesting in-house project.</description>

      <description>In the last project I worked on - processing financial batches - we put a lot of effort in avoiding being silently wrong. The practice that contributed most was being religious about avoiding structures to ever be in an invalid state. Preconditions, invariants, value objects and immutability were key.
One of the things we had to do with these structures was writing them to disk in a specific banking format; all the accounts with their transactions for a specific day.</description>

      <description>I normally write this up at the end of the year, but circumstances made me push back this post for a few weeks. I use this annual post to look back at the year passed, and to look ahead to the year to come. I gave up on making resolutions in 2011. This year, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be naively ambitious again going into 2014.
Compared to previous years, I feel more confident that I have a pretty good idea of what I want next.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I read this blog post by Michael Feathers. In the post he goes over a pain point he has often found himself struggling with while breaking down a large method; conditional statements. if (alarmEnabled) { var alarm = new Alarm(); ... alarm.Sound(); } Should we extract the if and the associated block into a new method, or just the content of the block? Is the condition too important to hide in a method?</description>

      <description>I heard a story once about an engineer who worked on the Disneyland site when it opened in Anaheim, CA in 1955. A month before the park opened, the new grass and sod were being applied to the grounds as one of the last items to be completed before the big grand opening. The parking lot was some distance from the park&amp;rsquo;s gates and required a lot of turf. However, the sidewalks had not been planned or constructed to accommodate patterns.</description>

      <description>Having covered projections last week, I think I have come full circle in these posts that turned out to be a small preliminary series on event sourcing. Even though there are still a vast amount of nuances to discover, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve captured the gist of it. Even without running an event sourced system in production - I feel as if I somewhat have an idea of what event sourcing can bring to the table.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying event sourcing from a distance for little over a year now; reading online material and going through some of the excellent OS code. Unfortunately, there would be no value introducing it into my current project - it would even be a terrible idea, so I decided to satisfy my inquisitiveness by consolidating and sharing my understanding of the concept.

      <title>Actor Model in COBOL</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/09/actor-model-in-cobol.html</link>

      <description>In an Actor system, each Actor acts as a self-contained and autonomous component. An Actor can only communicate with other Actors by exchanging messages - they are not allowed to share state. Messages are handled asynchronously, and are nondeterministic. The location of Actors should be transparent; they can either live on the same machine, or on a distributed system. These properties make the Actor Model a great fit for parallel and distributed computing.</description>

      <description>These last few days, I have been working on a piece of our codebase that accidentally got very inheritance heavy.
When it comes to inheritance versus composition, there are a few widely accepted rules of thumb out there. While prefer composition over inheritance doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover the nuances, it&amp;rsquo;s not terrible advice; composition will statistically often be the better solution. Steve McConnell&amp;rsquo;s composition defines a &amp;lsquo;has a&amp;rsquo;- relationship while inheritance defines an &amp;lsquo;is a&amp;rsquo;-relationship, gives you a more nuanced and simple tool to apply to a scenario.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, we set out to implement a feature that enabled back office users to set a new rate ahead of time. With our analyst and the involved user being out of the office for days, we had to solely rely on written requirements. Two of us skimmed the documents, but didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to assure there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any ambiguity - it looked trivial really. I went back to what I was doing, while my colleague set out to implement this feature.</description>

      <description>Hanging around in the pub after DDDX, I ended up talking to Alberto Brandolini. For those who have never met him; he&amp;rsquo;s very much into visualization. You will always see him carrying a drawing pad, with a dash of permanent marker on his cheek, and a few lost sticky notes on his back. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was the Italian accent and the strong gestures, or my mildly intoxicated condition, but the idea of visualization as an important tool grew on me even more that evening.</description>

      <description>When I wrote about accidental entities earlier, we followed a consultant building software for a car rental company. In the meanwhile, he has finished implementing the registration of new cars. Next on the list is allowing customers to make a booking.
We managed to get the CEO to set a whole hour apart to walk us over how the booking system should work.
 CEO: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure this meeting is going to take a whole hour though.</description>

      <description>This post is a follow-up to my previous blog post &amp;ldquo;Accidental entities - you don&amp;rsquo;t need that identity&amp;quot;.
In that post, we followed a consultant building an application for a car rental. One of the requirements was that the CEO could manage a collection of available colors. Although the tools at our disposal - a relational database and NHibernate - wanted to trick us into making a car reference one of these available colors by its identifier, we found out that the CEO really thinks of a car&amp;rsquo;s color as a value, and does not care about a color&amp;rsquo;s identity.</description>

      <description>An entity is identified by an identifier, while value objects are identified by their value.
If I make a living renting cars to tourists, I might not care the least about the identity of the colors the cars came in. I just care about their value; Rosso Corsa, Azurro Metallic&amp;hellip; If I repaint the car, the color changes, and the previous color is abandoned as a whole.
However, if I were a car paint manufacturer, I would care a great deal about the identity of a color.</description>

      <description>The first year I wrote software for a living I spent my days mostly writing forms over data applications; most of my efforts were wasted just trying to make things work using ASP.NET and the Webforms engine. It was only after a year and graduating from the School of Hard Knocks that I learned there is a lot more to building clean and maintainable software than knowing the ins&amp;rsquo; and outs&amp;rsquo; of a proprietary UI technology.</description>

      <description>Somewhere over a year and a half ago I discovered the music of Dire Straits, which has sparked a fanatical love and fascination for the guitar in me, and basically for every piece of music Mark Knopfler has ever touched (*). A year ago, I finally had the courage to pick up the guitar myself. Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;d stick with it, I made an uninformed purchase of a rather inexpensive Squier Jazzmaster, just because it somewhat resembled the real object of desire, a Fender Stratocaster.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing quite a bit about CQS (or command and query separation) lately. In my last post on using events, I already hinted towards bringing in the R; command and query responsibility separation.
With CQS, commands can mutate data, while queries can only read that data. CQRS takes this one step further, and assigns commands and queries each a dedicated model; we now talk of a write side, and a read side.</description>

      <description>When I started my first job, I hardly ever judged my peers. After all, how could I? Everything was unknown for me; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t differentiate good from bad. Over the years that has changed a bit, but with that, I&amp;rsquo;ve also slowly become more judgemental towards peers, often prematurely, and not always deservedly.
The first few months of last year, I found myself doing maintenance on a legacy code base between projects.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year again where I take some time to look back on the year passed and peek at the year ahead. This is mostly a post I like to write up for myself, forcing reflection.
The biggest personal changes this year were moving out of my parents&amp;rsquo; place, and my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s decision to study medicine after graduating as a Master of Arts earlier this year. I had no idea how things would turn out once we lived together, but so far we have been doing great.</description>

We should aspire to be the Gordon Ramsey of software, not the college student who can only cook Ramen noodles. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched or listened to her talk, you should; it&amp;rsquo;s only a few minutes long, and she brings it really well.</description>

      <description>On my first job interview, over four years ago, I was asked whether I would relocate if I was hired. Back then, I still lived in the Campine region with my parents, while the Ferranti Computer Systems headquarters are in Antwerp. I thought about it for a few seconds and told the interviewer that I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan on moving out of my parents&amp;rsquo; place in the first few years. Besides, the distance isn&amp;rsquo;t that great; it&amp;rsquo;s only 60km (=37 miles) of highway, how bad could it be?</description>

      <description>It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long before I noticed how little job titles mean. In my first job, you were assured to be granted a fancy title after only having acquired a minimum seniority, if you knew how to play the game. A more important sounding job title was HR&amp;rsquo;s default bribe that often kept people from leaving for greener pastures, for a short while. But even after being upgraded from a stable cleaner to a Senior Barn Hygiene Technician, you&amp;rsquo;re still cleaning shit though.</description>

      <description>While wading through an exotic codebase, I stumbled upon a static class named Convert. This class contained somewhere around 2700 (non-generated) lines of code, where each method manually converted some object to a simple textual representation. These methods were then used to convert requests and reponses to and from a remote third party service before logging them to the database for auditing reasons.
public static class Convert { public static string PaymentRequest(PaymentRequest req) { var sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.</description>

      <description>I have picked up a few new tools this summer (MongoDB, NancyFx and WebAPI), and it occurred to me that I&amp;rsquo;ve built certain habits these last few years in how I make use of all the learning resources out there.
I tried to identify all of them, to then categorize them, to finally order them according to in which phase of my study process I use them.
The written and spoken word The first thing I look for online is documentation.</description>

      <description>Back when I was working on software for fire departments, we started thinking about reworking a critical piece of our solution: deployment plans. In a fire department domain, deployment plans help to make a suggestion to the dispatcher about which units should be dispatched to a location when an incident is called in. The suggested composition of units depends on a wide range of variables: availability, response time, ranks, type of incident, required tools, &amp;hellip; , even politics.</description>

      <description>I wrote an article titled &amp;lsquo;The open plan fallacy&amp;rsquo; just two weeks ago. Earlier this week a similar article was published by the New York Times. The content of that article wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly extraordinary, but the comments were. I waded through all of them on my daily commute, and it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to find one in favor of open plan offices - people seem to be enraged.
I handpicked some of the most interesting ones.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked in a whole lot of places, somewhere around four, but every single one of them used an open plan to structure their workplace. From what I hear from others, it&amp;rsquo;s the standard.
There are a few things to say about the advantages of an open office layout. They should stimulate communication, create more opportunities for observing and learning from others and be more cost-effective. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid it&amp;rsquo;s the latter which is the biggest driver though.</description>

      <title>Why I will always love RSS</title>

      <description>There has been a lot of noise in the tech community earlier this year about how RSS is supposedly having one foot in the grave. If that would be even remotely true, I hope it dies with its boots on. The herald would be browsers and social networking sites killing or hiding support for RSS. While that may be true, their motives shouldn&amp;rsquo;t rig our opinions.
RSS has never worked out for the regular consumer, not directly anyways.</description>

      <title>Some Servicelocator pattern stinks</title>

      <description>I have been working on a somewhat legacy codebase which makes use of the Servicelocator pattern. Although I always thought of Dependecy Injection to be the superior pattern, I was pleased to find some Inversion of Control implementation in there. Working with the codebase, I discovered first hand how easily, when used without caution and discipline, the Servicelocator pattern can introduce code rot.
I will walk you through some of the issues I have with the Servicelocator pattern, mostly looking at it from a test perspective.</description>

      <description>I have had a fair amount of discussions on continuous learning and knowledge sharing the past few days. It became rather obvious that a lot of us have developed their own techniques, but also that maybe most of us are still in search of more efficient techniques. Having gone through several phases myself, I would like to share my current way of learning: the Hacker Way.
Here are some snippets taken from a recent letter from Mark Zuckerberg addressed to the Facebook shareholders.</description>
