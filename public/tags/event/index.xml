      <description>I just returned from a four day trip to Tunisia with Euricom. Next to indulging on the sun, food and all-inclusive cocktails, getting to know each other in a less professional setting, we spent somewhere around half of our days - and this is a rather generous estimate - doing technical sessions and workshops.I gave a 90 minute long crash course on REST and ASP.NET Web API.

      <description>Yesterday, I gave a talk on WebSockets at HTML5 WebCamps Belgium.
I got a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, which makes me a very happy panda!

You can already find the video of my session on Channel9.
The slides can be found on SlideShare.
If you want to play with the demo yourself, you can download the source:

      <description>HTML5 WebCamps is a free event organized by Microsoft Belgium and will take place on April 6th at Living Tomorrow.
In my session I will be talking about WebSockets.
 WebSockets on Fire
While the WebSockets API specification is not stable yet, various browser vendors have already implemented a prototype in their latest browser versions. Microsoft released their WebSockets prototype in December 2010. While there is no native implementation of WebSockets in IE9 just yet, for now they are providing a solution which works cross-browser, relying on a Silverlight client.</description>
