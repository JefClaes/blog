      <title>How to organize a meetup</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve organized a few DDDBE meetups in the past, and always succeed in forgetting something. Either someone points it out well in advance, or I end up stressing last minute. This post partly serves as a checklist for myself, but it would be a welcome side effect to also see it encourage others to help out organizing future meetups. Organizing a meetup is not rocket science, having a list of what to take care of is a good start.</description>

      <description>Writing doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always come naturally to me. It often takes me days, weeks or even months of toying with an idea, before I think it&amp;rsquo;s mature enough to put it down into writing. I can&amp;rsquo;t afford that luxury this time though, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think of myself as much of a friend if Pieter didn&amp;rsquo;t get to read this in time.
I met Pieter the first time in a bar in Vilnius, December 2013, I accidentally ended up sitting next to him during the traditional pre-conf drinks.</description>

      <description>Third time attending Build Stuff, first time doing a talk. I&amp;rsquo;m happy that it&amp;rsquo;s out of the way and can now just enjoy the conference, but I&amp;rsquo;m even more excited that it was well-received! The talk should have been recorded, but you can already find the abstract and slides below.
 Last year I ventured into the domain of (online) gambling. Given that the industry has been around since forever, I expected most problems to be of the technical kind.</description>

      <description>Me and Tom just finished doing our Event storming workshop at NCrafts Paris. Although we made a few mistakes along the way, feedback on the workshop was great. I hope to put something out about what we learned facilitating later this week. People talked, discovered and eventually learned a new domain in under two hours. The domain? Two minutes before the workshop we found a domain expert prepared to talk about his coupon start-up.</description>

      <description>I just returned from Croatia, where I got to speak twice at the second edition of The Geek Gathering.
Being such a young conference, I had no idea what to expect. Turns out they have a good thing going on; a small, local and very personal approach to conferences. Speakers both local and international, covering topics that serve the community, not their employer.
Together with Tom, I preached Alberto&amp;lsquo;s Event Storming during a four hour long workshop.</description>

      <title>DDDBE slides on the Ubiquitous Language</title>

      <description>Monday, I and four others did a DDDBE session on the strategic side of Domain Driven Design.
My talk covered the Ubiquitous Language, and can be found on Slideshare. I might end up writing down the content of the talk as well - some images are meaningless without words. Evaluating feedback, I think the biggest mistake we made was keeping some things too abstract - curse of knowledge at work. If we get the chance to repeat the session, we need to make sure to weave a practical story through our talks to make them stick.</description>

      <description>At Euricom, we quarterly all retreat to headquarters for a day of sharing and learning. This time, I and others organized and facilitated an event storming workshop.
After a short introduction on event storming participants were initiated to the domain of Cambio CarSharing - which is packed with behaviour. After that, seven groups of five (+ one domain expert) spread out across the office, and spent two slots of twenty minutes modeling the domain - with two extra slots for feedback.</description>

      <description>I just returned from our yearly Euricom retreat. This year, all forty of us got to spend four days in the South of Spain. Where we had longish sessions and a few workshops last year, we experimented with shorter talks this year - a la lightning talks, TEDx style.
This format made it possible for everyone to speak, but also forced the speaker to keep the scope of the talk focused, and to organize the information in a way that attendees can get the gist of it in only twelve minutes.</description>

      <title>The first DDDBE Modellathon</title>

      <description>On our way back from DDD Exchange, heavily influenced by yet another immersive DDD experience, we searched for ways to keep the momentum going. Sure, we met up regularly for CQRS beers, but we felt that we could do more, better. That&amp;rsquo;s when we coined the term modellathon, something like a hackathon, but instead of writing code, we would build models.
Thanks to the effort of Mathias, Stijn and Yves, Tuesday marked the first get-together of the Belgian DDD user group in its official form.</description>

      <description>This is the second and last part of my notes I scribbled down attending the IDDD Tour. The first part was published last week.
A better model  Even if you come up with a better model, the fact that it has been the ubiquitous language of the domain for decades proves that it works for them.
 This quote bothers me a bit. There definitely is truth to this, but modeling an existing process often presents such a great opportunity to revise and improve it.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago I got to spend four days attending the IDDD Tour by Vaughn Vernon. Although my book queue has only allowed me to shallowly browse the book, I had high hopes for this course. I anticipated a week of getting lectured on DDD with a few practical exercises, but was blown away by the openness and interaction promoted by Vaughn and his associate Alberto Brandolini. A passionate group, engaging workshops, long days and lots of sharing made these few days exceptionally satisfying and inspirational.</description>

      <description>A lot has already been said and written about meetings, and some have carried the message above par; &amp;lsquo;Meetings: where work goes to die&#39;. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to foul the internet with another rant, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to show you a small application built over the last few weeks after work.
I regularly find myself building small things as an antitoxin to the regular periods of not writing and shipping code at work.</description>

      <description>I attended and spoke at Web.NET Europe in Milan over the weekend. This was only my fourth full day- or more conference (Techdays Belgium, TechEd Berlin and HTML5 WebCamps), but it was undoubtedly the best one so far.
The quality of the sessions was definitely not inferior to those of bigger conferences. I especially enjoyed the talks on SignalR, OAuth and scaling data (I included some of my notes below). The strength of this conference doesn&amp;rsquo;t lie in the exceptional speakers or sessions though, but in its cozy size and the type of attendees it attracts.</description>

      <description>I just returned to the hotel after attending and speaking at Web.NET Europe 2012. There were multiple sessions on ASP.NET Web API today, and I was responsible for delivering the first one of the day. Being first, and to avoid overlap with others, I tried to lay a solid foundation by focusing on the REST and ASP.NET Web API basics: resources, identifiers, representations, verbs and hypermedia.
More people than I expected showed up for my talk; somewhere around 50 to 70 attendees, I guess.</description>

      <description>I just returned from a four day trip to Tunisia with Euricom. Next to indulging on the sun, food and all-inclusive cocktails, getting to know each other in a less professional setting, we spent somewhere around half of our days - and this is a rather generous estimate - doing technical sessions and workshops.
I gave a 90 minute long crash course on REST and ASP.NET Web API.

      <description>After writing a few things on HTML5 offline web applications earlier this year, I got contacted by InfoQ to write an in-detail article on the subject for them. I hesitated at first, because I was afraid that it would feel too much like work, taking the fun out of my writing. Turns out it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like that at all. The guys at infoQ were really relaxed to work with, asking interesting questions and giving useful feedback, without forcing me into a certain direction.</description>

      <description>My mini-website arealdeveloper.com will no longer be available online after tomorrow.
I slapped it together over a weekend, trying out WebMatrix, which turned out to be the perfect companion for building small things.
A pleasant surprise was the mention of &amp;lsquo;A Real Developer&amp;rsquo; by the guys at Channel9. This made the traffic go through the roof for a few days.
A few months later the site was a ghosttown. But I don&amp;rsquo;t mind, had to happen.</description>

      <description>While nosing around in the arealdeveloper.com analytics, I saw a bunch of traffic coming from Channel9. Clicking through, I found out A Real Developer was mentioned in this video (02:01). That&amp;rsquo;s a Channel9 front-page video!
That&amp;rsquo;s so awesome, I think it&amp;rsquo;s great people find it a fun project.
I have been listening to your feedback, and this Sunday I implemented some of your requests:

      <description>A Real Developer is a side-project I built over the weekend poking around with WebMatrix.

It got a little out of hand. After publishing, I showed it to a few popular tweeps, and they were kind enough to mention it. 24 hours after the launch it has gotten over 3.5k unique visitors, 39k page views (see what I did there?) and over 240 submissions. Being mentioned by Scott Hanselman and Rey Bango helps.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I gave a talk on WebSockets at HTML5 WebCamps Belgium.
 WebSockets on Fire
While the WebSockets API specification is not stable yet, various browser vendors have already implemented a prototype in their latest browser versions. Microsoft released their WebSockets prototype in December 2010. While there is no native implementation of WebSockets in IE9 just yet, for now they are providing a solution which works cross-browser, relying on a Silverlight client.</description>
