      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve organized a few DDDBE meetups in the past, and always succeed in forgetting something. Either someone points it out well in advance, or I end up stressing last minute. This post partly serves as a checklist for myself, but it would be a welcome side effect to also see it encourage others to help out organizing future meetups. Organizing a meetup is not rocket science, having a list of what to take care of is a good start.</description>

      <description>Writing doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always come naturally to me. It often takes me days, weeks or even months of toying with an idea, before I think it&amp;rsquo;s mature enough to put it down into writing. I can&amp;rsquo;t afford that luxury this time though, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think of myself as much of a friend if Pieter didn&amp;rsquo;t get to read this in time.
I met Pieter the first time in a bar in Vilnius, December 2013, I accidentally ended up sitting next to him during the traditional pre-conf drinks.</description>
