      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started reading the excellent paper &amp;ldquo;Patterns for Parallel Programming: Understanding and Applying Parallel Patterns with the .NET Framework 4&amp;quot;.
There is a section in this whitepaper which explains perfectly why parallel programming was and still is such an interesting problem.
 Consider an analogy: shopping with some friends at a grocery store. You come into the store with a grocery list, and you rip the list into one piece per friend, such that every friend is responsible for retrieving the elements on his or her list.</description>
