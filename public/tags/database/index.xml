      <description>I recently watched a talk on Vimeo where Christin Gorman talks about how cookie dough relates to Hibernate; why use the generic, bloated and one-fits-all solution when you can mix together your own yummy cookie dough? We should aspire to be the Gordon Ramsey of software, not the college student who can only cook Ramen noodles. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched or listened to her talk, you should; it&amp;rsquo;s only a few minutes long, and she brings it really well.</description>

      <description>While browsing the source code of the ELMAH mongoDB provider, I learned about a special type of collections: capped collections.
From the mongoDB documentation:
 Capped collections are fixed sized collections that have a very high performance auto-FIFO age-out feature (age out is based on insertion order). In addition, capped collections automatically, with high performance, maintain insertion order for the documents in the collection; this is very powerful for certain use cases such as logging.</description>
