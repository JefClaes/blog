      <description>Maybe the writing has been on the wall for Feedburner for a long time. No features were added for over four years, no bugs were fixed, the look-and-feel wasn&amp;rsquo;t updated to be consistent with other Google products, support channels were being shut down,&amp;hellip; But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until last Friday that the degradation of the service really got tangible: all subscriber counts indicated zero. Dozens of people complained, using all possible communication channels, but nobody listened.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of noise in the tech community earlier this year about how RSS is supposedly having one foot in the grave. If that would be even remotely true, I hope it dies with its boots on. The herald would be browsers and social networking sites killing or hiding support for RSS. While that may be true, their motives shouldn&amp;rsquo;t rig our opinions.
RSS has never worked out for the regular consumer, not directly anyways.</description>
