Arjan has a opinionated linkblog, on which he posts on a daily basis.
Here it goes..
Next to blogging, what do you do for a living?I&amp;rsquo;m a thirty-something developer from the Netherlands working as an inhouse .NET developer in a big company, somewhere in the Randstad (western part of the country). I mainly work on projects related to customer data in the broadest sense.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the use of stored procedures lately.

I asked the opinion of a few ASP.NET/.NET professionals. Hope you find this interesting!

In the web application I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on we chose a not so standard architecture I guess. We have multiple &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo;, which are folders in practice. In the root of these modules we hold our aspx pages.</description>
