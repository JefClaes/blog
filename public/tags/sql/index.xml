      <description>I have spent the last week working in an integration test suite that seemed to be taking ages to run its first test. I ran a profiler on the setup, and noticed a few things that were cheap to improve. The first one was how a new LocalDB database was being created.
An empty database file was included into the project. When running the setup, this file would replace the existing test database.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing quite a bit about CQS (or command and query separation) lately. In my last post on using events, I already hinted towards bringing in the R; command and query responsibility separation.
With CQS, commands can mutate data, while queries can only read that data. CQRS takes this one step further, and assigns commands and queries each a dedicated model; we now talk of a write side, and a read side.</description>

      <title>Some notes on performance tuning with NHibernate</title>

      <description>A few weeks back, I spent an intensive day performance tuning parts of a, to me, relatively unfamiliar part of our codebase. Like it often is, the biggest optimizations were to be found in how we work with the database. Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself to be an NHibernate expert; I read this book and have used it on two projects, but in the end I just do my best to avoid doing stupid things with it.</description>

      <description>While installing a SQL State Server last week, I came across a few things worth sharing about the installation and use of SQL State Server.
Finding a good tutorialThere are lots of tutorials out there on how to install SQL State Server but most of them are not great. To do a basic installation you only need this Msdn documentation on how to run the Aspnet_regsql.exe tool and edit your web.</description>

      <title>Stored Procedures: Make them or break them</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the use of stored procedures lately.
Some questions that popped up in my head: What are the advantages/disadvantages? When and how should they be used? Will they extinct with LINQ to SQL becoming more and more popular? Why should you store your queries in your database, instead of in your code..
I asked the opinion of a few ASP.NET/.NET professionals. Hope you find this interesting!
