      <description>My career
I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the same projects as I was last year: Firestation Antwerp and Ghent. This year we did not build a lot of brand new things, but we have added a decent amount of new functionalities. Next to that there were a bunch of bugs to fix and technical debt to pay off. I learned a lot from the mistakes we made and refactoring makes you really think about what good and clean code should look like.</description>

      <description>Today I have spent a few hours evaluating this year&amp;rsquo;s analytics of my blog. In total I posted 59 entries this year, but in this post you will only find the 5 most popular, plus the ones that I liked writing a lot but failed to make it to the top 5.

      <description>Today I finally took the time to redesign my blog.
The word redesign might be a bit exaggerated though. I downloaded the 2plus blogger template and tweaked it a little. Hope you like the new design!

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to reflect on the year that&amp;rsquo;s almost finished and the year to come.
I came up with a few topics that are worth discussing in this post.
My career
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever mentioned where I work. The first of January I will be working 18 months for Ferranti. The only company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for since I graduated.
The first project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on was a rather big one.</description>
