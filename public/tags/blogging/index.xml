      <description>Today I finally took the time to redesign my blog.
The word redesign might be a bit exaggerated though. I downloaded the 2plus blogger template and tweaked it a little. Hope you like the new design!

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to reflect on the year that&amp;rsquo;s almost finished and the year to come.
I came up with a few topics that are worth discussing in this post.
My career
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever mentioned where I work. The first of January I will be working 18 months for Ferranti. The only company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for since I graduated.
The first project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on was a rather big one.</description>
