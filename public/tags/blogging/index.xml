      <description>I look forward to writing this post each year; it&amp;rsquo;s by far the easiest one to write, and it provides me with an occasion to look back on previous years (2009, 2010, 2011). It&amp;rsquo;s entertaining - and shameful too - to see what kept me busy back then, which opinions I held, and which technologies and techniques are still relevant in the meanwhile. Anyways, here it goes.
The most read post this year, with 37.</description>

      <description>My career
I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the same projects as I was last year: Firestation Antwerp and Ghent. This year we did not build a lot of brand new things, but we have added a decent amount of new functionalities. Next to that there were a bunch of bugs to fix and technical debt to pay off. I learned a lot from the mistakes we made and refactoring makes you really think about what good and clean code should look like.</description>

      <description>Today I have spent a few hours evaluating this year&amp;rsquo;s analytics of my blog. In total I posted 59 entries this year, but in this post you will only find the 5 most popular, plus the ones that I liked writing a lot but failed to make it to the top 5.

      <description>Today Scott Hanselman did a session on blogging at the BWB (Blogging While Brown - yah seriously!) conference. He tweeted a link to the slides of this session. I embedded the slides in this post, but you can also get them from here.
Take your time to check out the slides. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a bit of a checklist, so it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take more than two minutes.
The slides pointed out a few things that were missing on my blog.</description>

      <description>Today I finally took the time to redesign my blog.
The word redesign might be a bit exaggerated though. I downloaded the 2plus blogger template and tweaked it a little. Hope you like the new design!

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to reflect on the year that&amp;rsquo;s almost finished and the year to come.
I came up with a few topics that are worth discussing in this post.
My career
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever mentioned where I work. The first of January I will be working 18 months for Ferranti. The only company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for since I graduated.
The first project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on was a rather big one.</description>
