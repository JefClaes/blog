      <description>Since I changed jobs, I do my daily commute by train. This adds two hours of leasure time to the day, which I used to lose in traffic.
So far, I have been spending these two won hours programming and/or reading. I have been looking for a way to read online content offline on my laptop. Searching for software that could make this happen, I mostly came across programs which would mirror a whole site locally.</description>

      <title>Comfortably numb</title>

      <description>Something that can bother me tremendously is being surrounded by people who are in a constant state of being comfortably numb. People who don&amp;rsquo;t welcome change, try to scare away new concepts and are just too much at home in their comfort zone. Some are perfectly happy filling their days keeping up appearances of being busy. They don&amp;rsquo;t care about self-improvement, but only care about augmenting their paychecks by accumulating as much legacy baggage as possible, with the sole intention of being perceived as an irreplaceable asset to the company, whilst not having to leave their comfort zone.</description>

      <description>Due to the nature of things we build in our day to day job, writing software can wear out even the most fit of us.
Most software jobs make you constantly deal with complexity. The amount of things which can lead to a complex software project are immense. A poor first design, and failure to redesign. External dependencies, which seem to behave different every time around. Or just the complexity of the problems itself.</description>

      <description>Over the years I have collected an impressive collection of technology related feeds in my Google Reader account. Lately, I find myself neglecting most of my Google Reader subscriptions, and getting my information from a few specific sources. It just has become too much of a chore to sift out the really interesting posts.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I have put my faith in the community to do the dirty work.</description>

      <description>Last week, I resigned from my job at Ferranti Computer Systems. Three years ago, days after receiving my Graduate Diploma in Applied Computer Science, I had my first real-world working experience at Ferranti Computer Systems.
The first project I was assigned to, was a project for the Antwerp fire department. Along with two other graduates and four seniors, I was thrown in at the deep end. I always had solid grades in school, and was fairly confident that I grasped the material I was taught.</description>

      <description>If you have been reading my blog lately, you know that I&amp;rsquo;m implementing some data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. So far, I have blogged about simple sorting algorithms, the stack data structure and the queue data structure. This week I have also implemented a doubly linked list. I started writing a post about that last implementation, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t like where it was going, so instead of writing about it, I have pushed everything to a public Git repository.</description>

      <title>Have you ever typed code on a job interview? Results</title>

      <description>As more established bloggers have argued before, there is something essentially wrong with job interviews in our industry. Software companies hire developers without even making them touch a keyboard. As long as you talk the walk you are able to land yourself a decent position. There are complete lists of .NET interview questions out there, which should, with enough preparation, make it possible for a somewhat technologiable person to ace the average .</description>

      <description>My career
I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the same projects as I was last year: Firestation Antwerp and Ghent. This year we did not build a lot of brand new things, but we have added a decent amount of new functionalities. Next to that there were a bunch of bugs to fix and technical debt to pay off. I learned a lot from the mistakes we made and refactoring makes you really think about what good and clean code should look like.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to reflect on the year that&amp;rsquo;s almost finished and the year to come.
I came up with a few topics that are worth discussing in this post.
My career
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever mentioned where I work. The first of January I will be working 18 months for Ferranti. The only company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for since I graduated.
The first project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on was a rather big one.</description>

      <description>Last week I went to Madrid with my family-in-law to visit my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s brother and cousin.
Although our stay there was rather short (only four days), we visited some of the most impressive places in Madrid:
 - Stadium Real Madrid
 The Royal Palace Prado Museum Queen Sofia Museum Buen Retiro Park Plaza Mayor &amp;hellip;   As always my girlfriend took lots of pictures, you can find my favorites below.</description>

      <title>Why code reviews should be a teamthing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2009/08/why-code-reviews-should-be-a-teamthing/</link>

      <description>Often code reviews are done by one person, the technical lead of your team.
In my opinion it&amp;rsquo;s better to make each developer of your team do code reviews.
My arguments Having all developers doing code reviews enforces well-documented coding standards.. Which also leads to discussions about what these codings tandards should be. Each developer is forced to understand the workflow of an application which isn&amp;rsquo;t his, which expands his domain knowledge.</description>

      <description>Last week I went on a holiday to France with my girlfriend and her family.
Because pictures say more than words..
One: The location - Laguepie, Albi
Two: The house and &amp;ldquo;la piscine&amp;quot;
Three: Me enjoying the sun
Four: Only in France you find a 1955 Peugeot 403 with numberplates just standing there next to the road
Five: Random picture of one of the towns next to Laguepie
Looking forward to the next holiday :)</description>

      <description>Nowadays all you here is: hey let&amp;rsquo;s outsource our call center, our IT department, our developer team.. to India. I asked Mudassar Ahmed Khan a few questions about how it&amp;rsquo;s like being a developer in India.

How is it like to be a developer in India?Quite bad..
 You get into heavy competition from day one when you join a Computer Science course. Companies set percentage criteria for young graduates.</description>
