      <description>My career
I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the same projects as I was last year: Firestation Antwerp and Ghent. This year we did not build a lot of brand new things, but we have added a decent amount of new functionalities. Next to that there were a bunch of bugs to fix and technical debt to pay off. I learned a lot from the mistakes we made and refactoring makes you really think about what good and clean code should look like.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to reflect on the year that&amp;rsquo;s almost finished and the year to come.
I came up with a few topics that are worth discussing in this post.
My career
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever mentioned where I work. The first of January I will be working 18 months for Ferranti. The only company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for since I graduated.
The first project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on was a rather big one.</description>

      <description>Last week I went to Madrid with my family-in-law to visit my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s brother and cousin.
Although our stay there was rather short (only four days), we visited some of the most impressive places in Madrid:
 - Stadium Real Madrid
 The Royal Palace Prado Museum Queen Sofia Museum Buen Retiro Park Plaza Mayor &amp;hellip;   As always my girlfriend took lots of pictures, you can find my favorites below.</description>

      <title>Why code reviews should be a teamthing</title>

      <description>Often code reviews are done by one person, the technical lead of your team.
In my opinion it&amp;rsquo;s better to make each developer of your team do code reviews.
My arguments Having all developers doing code reviews enforces well-documented coding standards.. Which also leads to discussions about what these coding standards should be. Each developer is forced to understand the workflow of an application which isn&amp;rsquo;t his, which expands his domain knowledge.</description>

      <description>Last week I went on a holiday to France with my girlfriend and her family.
Because pictures say more than words..
One: The location - Laguepie, Albi
Two: The house and &amp;ldquo;la piscine&amp;quot;
Three: Me enjoying the sun
Four: Only in France you find a 1955 Peugeot 403 with numberplates just standing there next to the road
Five: Random picture of one of the towns next to Laguepie
Looking forward to the next holiday :)</description>
