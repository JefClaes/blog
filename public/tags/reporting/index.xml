      <description>Even though our title says Developer, it&amp;rsquo;s hard for most of us to escape doing a system administrator task once in a while.
I had to add SQL Server Reporting Services to an existing SQL Server 2005 installation. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a big deal. Mount the SQL Server installation image, run the setup and follow the installation wizard to add extra components. Arriving at the step where I should be able to select Reporting Services, the Reporting Services option was grayed out.</description>

      <title>Switching with non-constant cases in C#</title>

      <description>Last week I came across a scenario where I wanted to switch over non-constants (aka variables), but while I was compiling I got Compiler Error CS0150 (A constant value is expected). This is one of those things I always forget. You can&amp;rsquo;t use variables in your case statements because the C# compiler doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to. It&amp;rsquo;s very logical though, the compiler forces you to use constants because otherwise there is no way of knowing there are equal case statements.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been upgrading a local report which contains multiple subreports, and yes I got that &amp;ldquo;SubReport could not be shown.&amp;rdquo; error more than once.
Debugging this error is a pain in the a.. All you get is &amp;ldquo;SubReport could not be shown.&amp;quot;, making me want to punch my screen and scream &amp;ldquo;BUT WHY?&amp;ldquo;Just before breaking my screen and going on full tilt, I decided to take a step back and run through my checklist.</description>
