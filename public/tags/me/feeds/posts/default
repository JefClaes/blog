      <description>I normally write this up at the end of the year, but circumstances made me push back this post for a few weeks. I use this annual post to look back at the year passed, and to look ahead to the year to come. I gave up on making resolutions in 2011. This year, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be naively ambitious again going into 2014.
Compared to previous years, I feel more confident that I have a pretty good idea of what I want next.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year again where I take some time to look back on the year passed and peek at the year ahead. This is mostly a post I like to write up for myself, forcing reflection.
The biggest personal changes this year were moving out of my parents&amp;rsquo; place, and my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s decision to study medicine after graduating as a Master of Arts earlier this year. I had no idea how things would turn out once we lived together, but so far we have been doing great.</description>

      <title>2011 Annual Review</title>

      <description>Since the end of the year is approaching, I would like to look back on 2011 and take a peek at 2012. Unlike the years before, I&amp;rsquo;m hardly setting any goals this year. Interests change so quickly, and new opportunities present themselves so regularly, I feel like it might be ignorant to set these things in stone.
My career The year started out interesting, working on a brand new product for fire departments at Ferranti Computer Systems.</description>

      <description>My career I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the same projects as I was last year: Firestation Antwerp and Ghent. This year we did not build a lot of brand new things, but we have added a decent amount of new functionalities. Next to that there were a bunch of bugs to fix and technical debt to pay off. I learned a lot from the mistakes we made and refactoring makes you really think about what good and clean code should look like.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to reflect on the year that&amp;rsquo;s almost finished and the year to come.
I came up with a few topics that are worth discussing in this post.
My career I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever mentioned where I work. The first of January I will be working 18 months for Ferranti. The only company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for since I graduated.
The first project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on was a rather big one.</description>
