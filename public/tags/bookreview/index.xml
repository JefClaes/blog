      <description>This Christmas, my girlfriend and I got this little book called It&amp;rsquo;s not how good you are, it&amp;rsquo;s how good you want to be. This book is mainly directed to (advertisement) designers, but since I feel that designers and developers do have a few things in common, we both like to create things, I also read it.
The content of this book is a collection of Paul Ardens observations on business and life presented in a very consumable format.</description>

      <title>Why I still buy real books</title>

      <description>As a technology geek, it should be hard to keep ignoring the latest generation of eReaders (read: the Kindle). With over three million devices sold, the Kindle has proven that it adds value to people&amp;rsquo;s lives, and that it&amp;rsquo;s a lot more than just a gadget.
Some of the most obvious benefits&amp;hellip; You can carry a whole library in your backpack. The price of an eBook often is substantially less than the hardcover version.</description>

      <description>The book The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World was written by Chris Guillebeau.
I learned about this book through Chris&amp;rsquo; blog. He hosts a very popular blog where he writes on lifehacking, entrepreneurship and his goal to travel to each country in the world.
In this book Chris tries to show the reader that you don&amp;rsquo;t have the live your life the way other people expect you to.</description>

      <title>Book review: Got Fight?</title>

      <description>I rarely review books with non-technical content here, but I just felt like I had to with this one.
The book Got Fight? was written by Forrest Griffin, assisted by Erich Krauss.
Forrest Griffin is one of the toughest light-heavyweight mixed martial artists competing in the UFC. If you are unfamiliar with MMA and UFC, I encourage you to watch one of the Forrest Griffin tribute videos on Youtube.</description>

      <title>Book review: Object-Oriented JavaScript</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2010/02/book-review-object-oriented-javascript/</link>

      <description>Although I&amp;rsquo;ve made my feet wet with various JavaScript frameworks, I am not a JavaScript hero at all. This might be one of the disadvantages of being a WebForms developer and having great toolkits at hand like the AJAX Control Toolkit and Telerik RADControls.
Because you really can&amp;rsquo;t call yourself a webdeveloper without having some understanding of JavaScript I decided to order Object-Oriented Javascript by Stoyan Stefanov.
This book really handles the language itself.</description>

      <title>Book review: Professional Refactoring in C# &amp; ASP.NET</title>

      <description>Three months ago I was looking up to refactoring a legacy ASP.NET Webforms application. Although I was familiar with refactoring, I ordered &amp;ldquo;Professional Refactoring in C# &amp;amp; ASP.NET&amp;rdquo; by Daniejel Arsenovski to get deeper into refactoring.
The titleAlthough the title states &amp;ldquo;Professional&amp;rdquo;, I think this book should find it&amp;rsquo;s main audience in coding novices. Another problem with the title is the word ASP.NET in it. The book has one chapter covering ASP.</description>
