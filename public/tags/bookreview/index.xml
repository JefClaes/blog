      <description>This Christmas, my girlfriend and I got this little book called It&amp;rsquo;s not how good you are, it&amp;rsquo;s how good you want to be.
This book is mainly directed to (advertisement) designers, but since I feel that designers and developers do have a few things in common, we both like to create things, I also read it.
The content of this book is a collection of Paul Ardens observations on business and life presented in a very consumable format.</description>
