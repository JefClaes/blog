      <description>This Christmas, my girlfriend and I got this little book called It&amp;rsquo;s not how good you are, it&amp;rsquo;s how good you want to be.
This book is mainly directed to (advertisement) designers, but since I feel that designers and developers do have a few things in common, we both like to create things, I also read it.
The content of this book is a collection of Paul Ardens observations on business and life presented in a very consumable format.</description>

      <title>Book review: Object-Oriented JavaScript</title>

      <description>Although I&amp;rsquo;ve made my feet wet with various JavaScript frameworks, I am not a JavaScript hero at all. This might be one of the disadvantages of being a WebForms developer and having great toolkits at hand like the AJAX Control Toolkit and Telerik RADControls.
Because you really can&amp;rsquo;t call yourself a webdeveloper without having some understanding of JavaScript I decided to order Object-Oriented Javascript by Stoyan Stefanov.
This book really handles the language itself.</description>

      <description>Three months ago I was looking up to refactoring a legacy ASP.NET Webforms application. Although I was familiar with refactoring, I ordered &amp;ldquo;Professional Refactoring in C# &amp;amp; ASP.NET&amp;rdquo; by Daniejel Arsenovski to get deeper into refactoring.
The titleAlthough the title states &amp;ldquo;Professional&amp;rdquo;, I think this book should find it&amp;rsquo;s main audience in coding novices. Another problem with the title is the word ASP.NET in it. The book has one chapter covering ASP.</description>
