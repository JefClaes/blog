      <description>With transitioning to ASP.NET MVC, I see our JavaScript codebase increasing exponentially. And this is a big win, unless we fail to keep that codebase maintainable. We mainly rely on jQuery to do our DOM manipulations, so it&amp;rsquo;s only logical for us to abstract those manipulations into reusable jQuery plugins.
So today, I wrote my first jQuery plugin and named it jRoll.
jRoll
jRoll is a plugin that finds all the (external) links in a jQuery object, and replaces the value of the href attribute with a value you specified.</description>

      <title>Using JSON serialization outside a web context</title>

      <description>You usually are in a web context if you are working with JSON, where JSON serialization almost always is encapsulated by the framework. You might accidentally come across scenarios where you want to serialize and deserialize JSON in a non-web context though.
Turns out this is fairly trivial since .NET 3.5. .NET 3.5 added the JavaScriptSerializer class. You can find this class in the System.Web.Script.Serialization namespace. To access this namespace you need to reference the System.</description>

      <title>HTML5 selectors and jQuery</title>

      <description>In my first post on the HTML5 javascript Selector API I wondered how the new methods querySelector() and querySelectorAll() would influence jQuery.
At the time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information on the subject, but yesterday I found out that jQuery has been taking advantage of these new methods since version 1.4.3.
From the release notes..
 The performance of nearly all the major traversal methods has been drastically improved. .closest(), .</description>

      <description>Generating tagclouds is nothing new. People have been generating tagclouds server-side since the seventies. Lately more and more tagclouds are being generated client-side.
There is nothing wrong with generating tagclouds server-side. Telerik has a great tagcloud server control. Generating tagclouds server-side can bring some overhead though, so depending on the scenario and the requirements you might decide to do it client-side. There are a ton of fancy ready-to-use jQuery tagcloud plug-ins out there.</description>

      <description>The people who follow my blog might remember the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 series. In these series I showed some of the core features of the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 beta javascript library.
In January Microsoft told us that they would ship the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 library as a part of the Microsoft Ajax framework, together with the release of ASP.NET 4.0. A few days ago I was ready to dig in the library a little deeper, but I found out that most of the documentation and resources I used to consult, had moved or had disappeared.</description>
