      <title>HTML5: The Geolocation API is scary (good)</title>

      <description>I read about the HTML5 Geolocation API in the Pro HTML5 Programming book a while ago, and decided to play with it on this lazy Sunday.
Using the Geolocation API to make a one-shot position request is very straight-forward. Get a reference to the navigator.geolocation object and call the getCurrentPosition() method, passing in at least a PositionCallback. In this example I&amp;rsquo;m also passing in a PositionErrorCallback. In the PositionCallback you can examine the properties of the position object.</description>

      <title>HTML5 selectors and jQuery</title>

      <description>In my first post on the HTML5 javascript Selector API I wondered how the new methods querySelector() and querySelectorAll() would influence jQuery.
At the time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information on the subject, but yesterday I found out that jQuery has been taking advantage of these new methods since version 1.4.3.
From the release notes..
 The performance of nearly all the major traversal methods has been drastically improved. .closest(), .</description>

      <title>More accurate javascript execution time measurement with the msPerformance API</title>

      <description>A cool feature of Internet Explorer 9 is the msPerformance API. This API helps you to accurately measure the performance of a webpage. A lot of developers have built their own performance measurement constructs over the years, based on the Date function, but the results of these constructs can be way off!
John Resig (jQuery inventor) has an in detail blogpost where he discovers where custom javascript execution time measurement goes wrong.</description>

      <title>HTML5: Drawing images to the canvas gotcha</title>

      <description>While I was playing with the Canvas API I came across a weird issue: I was trying to draw an image to the canvas, but the image failed to render very often.
Have a look at the source. Do you spot the problem?
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;HTML5: Canvas&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt; window.addEventListener(&amp;quot;load&amp;quot;, draw, true); function draw(){ var canvas = document.getElementById(&#39;canvas&#39;); var context = canvas.getContext(&#39;2d&#39;); var img = new Image(); img.src = &amp;quot;http://3.</description>

      <title>HTML5: More on selectors</title>

      <description>Last weekend I blogged on new addittions to the javascript Selector API: querySelector() and querySelectorAll(). These two new methods enable you to find elements by matching against a group of selectors. I only scratched the surface in the previous post, that&amp;rsquo;s why you can find a few more examples in this post. These examples should demonstrate the power and ease of use of the new Selector API features. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to show you all of the selectors usages in just one post, that&amp;rsquo;s why I strongly encourage you to have a look at the W3C Selectors specifications.</description>

      <description>Because I finally got the MCTS 70-536 certification out of the way, I can start experimenting with some fun stuff again. One of the things on the top of my list is HTML5. I started reading the book Pro HTML5 Programming, so expect more posts on HTML5 in the near future.
In this post I will show you two new methods in the javascript Selector API which are extremely useful to find elements.</description>

      <description>The people who follow my blog might remember the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 series. In these series I showed some of the core features of the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 beta javascript library.
In January Microsoft told us that they would ship the ASP.NET Ajax 4.0 library as a part of the Microsoft Ajax framework, together with the release of ASP.NET 4.0. A few days ago I was ready to dig in the library a little deeper, but I found out that most of the documentation and resources I used to consult, had moved or had disappeared.</description>

      <title>Book review: Object-Oriented JavaScript</title>

      <description>Although I&amp;rsquo;ve made my feet wet with various JavaScript frameworks, I am not a JavaScript hero at all. This might be one of the disadvantages of being a WebForms developer and having great toolkits at hand like the AJAX Control Toolkit and Telerik RADControls.
Because you really can&amp;rsquo;t call yourself a webdeveloper without having some understanding of JavaScript I decided to order Object-Oriented Javascript by Stoyan Stefanov.
This book really handles the language itself.</description>
