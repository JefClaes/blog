      <description>While nosing around in the arealdeveloper.com analytics, I saw a bunch of traffic coming from Channel9. Clicking through, I found out A Real Developer was mentioned in this video (02:01). That&amp;rsquo;s a Channel9 front-page video!
That&amp;rsquo;s so awesome, I think it&amp;rsquo;s great people find it a fun project.
I have been listening to your feedback, and this Sunday I implemented some of your requests:
 Easier linking Sharing A feed Voting Comments  I try to keep everything as simple as possible, that&amp;rsquo;s why I implemented most of these features using two popular free plug-ins: AddThis and Disqus.</description>

      <description>A Real Developer is a side-project I built over the weekend poking around with WebMatrix.

It got a little out of hand. After publishing, I showed it to a few popular tweeps, and they were kind enough to mention it. 24 hours after the launch it has gotten over 3.5k unique visitors, 39k page views (see what I did there?) and over 240 submissions. Being mentioned by Scott Hanselman and Rey Bango helps.</description>
