      <description>Third time attending Build Stuff, first time doing a talk. I&amp;rsquo;m happy that it&amp;rsquo;s out of the way and can now just enjoy the conference, but I&amp;rsquo;m even more excited that it was well-received! The talk should have been recorded, but you can already find the abstract and slides below.
 Last year I ventured into the domain of (online) gambling. Given that the industry has been around since forever, I expected most problems to be of the technical kind.</description>

      <description>Me and Tom just finished doing our Event storming workshop at NCrafts Paris. Although we made a few mistakes along the way, feedback on the workshop was great. I hope to put something out about what we learned facilitating later this week. People talked, discovered and eventually learned a new domain in under two hours. The domain? Two minutes before the workshop we found a domain expert prepared to talk about his coupon start-up.</description>

      <description>I just returned from Croatia, where I got to speak twice at the second edition of The Geek Gathering.
Being such a young conference, I had no idea what to expect. Turns out they have a good thing going on; a small, local and very personal approach to conferences. Speakers both local and international, covering topics that serve the community, not their employer.
Together with Tom, I preached Alberto&amp;lsquo;s Event Storming during a four hour long workshop.</description>

      <title>DDDBE slides on the Ubiquitous Language</title>

      <description>Monday, I and four others did a DDDBE session on the strategic side of Domain Driven Design.
My talk covered the Ubiquitous Language, and can be found on Slideshare. I might end up writing down the content of the talk as well - some images are meaningless without words. Evaluating feedback, I think the biggest mistake we made was keeping some things too abstract - curse of knowledge at work. If we get the chance to repeat the session, we need to make sure to weave a practical story through our talks to make them stick.</description>

      <description>At Euricom, we quarterly all retreat to headquarters for a day of sharing and learning. This time, I and others organized and facilitated an event storming workshop.
After a short introduction on event storming participants were initiated to the domain of Cambio CarSharing - which is packed with behaviour. After that, seven groups of five (+ one domain expert) spread out across the office, and spent two slots of twenty minutes modeling the domain - with two extra slots for feedback.</description>

      <description>I just returned from our yearly Euricom retreat. This year, all forty of us got to spend four days in the South of Spain. Where we had longish sessions and a few workshops last year, we experimented with shorter talks this year - a la lightning talks, TEDx style.
This format made it possible for everyone to speak, but also forced the speaker to keep the scope of the talk focused, and to organize the information in a way that attendees can get the gist of it in only twelve minutes.</description>
