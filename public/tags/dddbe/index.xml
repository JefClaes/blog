      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve organized a few DDDBE meetups in the past, and always succeed in forgetting something. Either someone points it out well in advance, or I end up stressing last minute. This post partly serves as a checklist for myself, but it would be a welcome side effect to also see it encourage others to help out organizing future meetups. Organizing a meetup is not rocket science, having a list of what to take care of is a good start.</description>

      <description>Monday, I and four others did a DDDBE session on the strategic side of Domain Driven Design.
My talk covered the Ubiquitous Language, and can be found on Slideshare or embedded below. I might end up writing down the content of the talk as well - some images are meaningless without words.Â Evaluating feedback, I think the biggest mistake we made was keeping some things too abstract - curse of knowledge at work.</description>

      <title>The first DDDBE Modellathon</title>

      <description>On our way back from DDD Exchange, heavily influenced by yet another immersive DDD experience, we searched for ways to keep the momentum going. Sure, we met up regularly for CQRS beers, but we felt that we could do more, better. That&amp;rsquo;s when we coined the term modellathon, something like a hackathon, but instead of writing code, we would build models.
Thanks to the effort of Mathias, Stijn and Yves, Tuesday marked the first get-together of the Belgian DDD user group in its official form.</description>
