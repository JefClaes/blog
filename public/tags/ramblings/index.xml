      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of my days in Webforms the last two years. In this post I want to share some best practices I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the hard way over these years. A lot of MVC developers might think this post comes a bit late (who still cares about Webforms?!), I do think (in the real world) a lot of the ASP.NET developers are still using Webforms. This post is directly targeting them.</description>

      <description>A little story I found which I think relates to software development in a way..
 A tourist once visited a temple under construction where he saw a sculptor making an idol of God. Suddenly he noticed a similar idol lying nearby. Surprised, he asked the sculptor, &amp;ldquo;Do you need two statues of the same idol?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; said the sculptor without looking up, &amp;ldquo;We need only one, but the first one got damaged at the last stage.</description>

      <description>Often code reviews are done by one person, the technical lead of your team.
In my opinion it&amp;rsquo;s better to make each developer of your team do code reviews.
My arguments Having all developers doing code reviews enforces well-documented coding standards.. Which also leads to discussions about what these coding standards should be. Each developer is forced to understand the workflow of an application which isn&amp;rsquo;t his, which expands his domain knowledge.</description>
