      <description>This week I decided to buy a new PC, because my old one was randomly rebooting, was really out-of-date and because I deserved it.
My old PC had turned into a Frankenstein PC over the years, that&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to write a little summary of the modifications I did to it over the years.

 My new PC only had a 40GB hard drive, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t that big of a problem at first.</description>
