      <description>A little while ago the city of Antwerp released their Open Data initiative, and it included a meetup where you could show something you built, build something on the spot, or pitch your ideas. When I first heard of the initiative I had nothing going on the side, and was looking for something tangible I could build to try out a few technologies. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t come up with an original idea, and ended up building two web applications using the Open Data datasets: Culture Mosaic, and Where to pee in Antwerp?</description>

      <description>I built my first application with angular.js over these last few weeks (not during business hours), and although I still have lots and lots to discover and learn, I think I somewhat grasp the basics.
In the application I built, I had to implement paging because rendering all the items at once was too slow on mobile devices (on my Windows Phone 7 anyways). The paging variant I decided on was the &amp;lsquo;Show More&amp;rsquo; technique.</description>
