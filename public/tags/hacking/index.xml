      <description>By default, IIS will shut down your application pool when it has been idle for more than 20 minutes. This is annoying when your website is only visited sporadically; visitors might not have the patience to wait for your application pool to spin up again. When you&amp;rsquo;re running your own machine, you can higher or disable the idle-timeout, but when you&amp;rsquo;re running on a cloud service like AppHarbor you can&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>A little while ago the city of Antwerp released their Open Data initiative, and it included a meetup where you could show something you built, build something on the spot, or pitch your ideas. When I first heard of the initiative I had nothing going on the side, and was looking for something tangible I could build to try out a few technologies. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t come up with an original idea, and ended up building two web applications using the Open Data datasets: Culture Mosaic, and Where to pee in Antwerp?</description>
