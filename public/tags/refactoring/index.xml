      <description>I have been working on a somewhat legacy codebase which makes use of the Servicelocator pattern. Although I always thought of Dependecy Injection to be the superior pattern, I was pleased to find some Inversion of Control implementation in there. Working with the codebase, I discovered first hand how easily, when used without caution and discipline, the Servicelocator pattern can introduce code rot.
I will walk you through some of the issues I have with the Servicelocator pattern, mostly looking at it from a test perspective.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I blogged on &amp;lsquo;WebForms refactoring: Eliminating redundant eventhandlers using a dictionary to map controls&#39;. In this post I went from bad code to better code. A smart reader gave me some good pointers on how to improve this code some more. Another iteration was necessary.
Losing the LinqIn the previous iteration I used Linq to search my dictionary.
 1: var res = mappings.Where(map =&amp;gt; map.Key.Equals((CheckBox)sender)).First();  This is overhead, because the dictionary implements an indexer.</description>

      <description>Last week I came across a problem which seemed trivial at first sight, but turned out to be a pretty fun refactoring challenge.
The scenarioThe real problem was a bit more complex, but for simplicity&amp;rsquo;s sake I made this example. In this form there are three checkboxes which map with the textboxes next to them. If the checkbox gets unchecked the corresponding textboxes should be cleared.

First iterationI warn you.</description>
