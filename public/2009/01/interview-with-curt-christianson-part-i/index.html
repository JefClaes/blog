<p>I have divided his interview in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->two

<ul>
<li>His career and his life</li>
<li>Some techtalk on mainly ASP.NET webproject-architecture mixed with a

</ul>
<h3 id="part-1-career-and-life">Part 1: Career and life</h3>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who are you? Where do you live? What do
you do for a living?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The question of who I am is a toughie&hellip; I&rsquo;m really at a transition
point in my life. For years now (too many to count) I would have simply
answered &ldquo;geek&rdquo; but with this last year coming to a close and the start
of a new one I feel like I&rsquo;ve also hit a changing point. I&rsquo;ve refocused
my energies on my life and family (just got engaged, just bought a new
house) and shifted away from a lot of the day to day &ldquo;geekdom&rdquo; that
ruled me (I closed up my consulting business). I live, and grew up, in
Central Wisconsin. The weather is nice (excluding the heavy winter
months), the cost of living is great and the education systems are
really quite great (thinking about starting a family soon). I pay the
bills with a good job as a high level programmer with Asp.Net at a good
sized insurance company. It&rsquo;s not the glamorous lifestyle but it&rsquo;s
definitely a solid position with a good future. For a number of years I
supplemented my daily work with private applications development with my
consulting business but eventually the time comes where you need to pick
priorities and, as it should, family and friends won out.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How old are you? How long have you been
into software development? Can you describe your experience as a junior
developer?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m currently 36 and have been in the computer industry
(professionally) for about 12 years but I&rsquo;ve really been a geek since I
got my first Atari 2600. My career is actually one that&rsquo;s a little
different (I think) from most of the Sr. level developers out there.
First off I actually went to school for something completely different.
I was an English Lit. major in college (I attended the University of
Wisconsin) but after 5 years I called it quits and left when I couldn&rsquo;t
afford it anymore. When I returned from school I took a job at a
software duplication company working the line. It was a 100%
non-technical position and simply an assembly line type thing. While
working there the equipment would break a lot&hellip; so I tended to take on
the initiative of fixing the stuff myself. Eventually they hired me into
their tech support area but that was pretty boring to me. I left there
and went to work for an off-shoot of the state where I traveled around
and worked at distance learning labs all around the State. I also was
contracted out to help out a couple school districts in the area part of
the time. My focus was all on the networking and server side of things.
That lead me to another company that was an actual software focused
business but my role was more of one of server setups and networking
support again. After a few years I got pretty bored with it. Eventually
I got a job as an Asp developer (not Asp.Net but the old stuff) for a
construction company. I pumped out some great work while I was there and
actually got noticed by Microsoft and was awarded the MVP award for the
first time. That was October 2002 I believe. The company I was at was
has a very small I.T. area and I started to get the itch to do more so I
took the opportunity to go to an insurance company specializing in
travel related products. I stayed there for about 3 years and really
honed my .Net skills. Like most of us I got the itch again and moved on
to a larger company. This time it was another insurance business but
with a huge I.T. area and some incredible projects underway. That was
about 3 years ago now and things are still going strong..</p>
<p>For me to describe my time as a Junior developer it would really only be
one word&hellip;.&ldquo;short&rdquo;. When I started development the programming
department at the company I was at consisted of ME&hellip;.. There were a few
others but for the stuff that I was doing there wasn&rsquo;t anyone but me
really (and the newsgroups&hellip;they saved me). With this, I really had to
immediately step up and take on a more controlling role. So in reality
my first programming job was as a Sr. developer and from there I
continued to take on new roles at new companies but always in a lead/Sr.
type position. I think there are some developers out there that are
destined to always be a Jr. developer. Some lack passion, others skill,
but most of the ones out there that have at least one of those two
things (or better yet, both) will quickly find themselves climbing the
ranks. People who love what they do will get noticed and that will
usually be the key to getting the next step up the ladder.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When did you start up your consulting
business? What are your thoughts afterwards on having a consulting
business together with a fulltime-job? Is it worth it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as my consulting business goes it&rsquo;s really a two-parter.
First off, back in the late 90&rsquo;s I had a computer business that I ran.
Mostly I built custom PCs for people and would come out to their house
to fix problems they had. This wasn&rsquo;t too bad but the profit margins
(thanks to all the online retailers starting out) were tanking and there
was little money left to be made. I closed up that business but took the
pieces I learned and in 2000 started up df-Softare. I was writing custom
apps (mostly web portals) for the small and mid-sized businesses out
there. It was something I really enjoyed doing and managed to make a few
bucks although it was never significant enough to let me quit my day
job. I ran df-Software and had a pretty good time but eventually the
time impact was a little too much and I decided to close shop. I still
do the occasional site but these days it&rsquo;s mostly for fun. Was it all
worth it? Sure&hellip; besides really learning a lot about way things can go
wrong it also led me down a path where I had the MVP award for 6 years.
The MVP title really was a huge perk when job hunting too. Besides those
things it also let me see what it really takes to survive in the
business world. It&rsquo;s a lot harder than it looks! Those things really
helped me become a better person outside of work too I think. It&rsquo;s
easier to see outside of your own &ldquo;box&rdquo; and look in from the other
perspective now and then.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazing career! In your current job..
What is it exactly that you do? Are you developing 100% of the time? Or
are you more of a team leader/systems architect who instructs the other
developers, tells them what to do and how to do it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Currently my role is as a Sr. Programmer. The company I&rsquo;m at has
it&rsquo;s own Architecture area as well as segregating the Middleware and
Data teams out from the developers. Unofficially I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;goto guy&rdquo; for
anything .Net or even just general programming. With the projects I&rsquo;m
currently on I spend about 60% of my time coding and the remaining 40%
doing coordination and assisting others. I&rsquo;ve also acted as a liason
with the University locally and worked as the lead for their Comp. Sci.
480 students who come to our company under that program. It&rsquo;s like an
internship.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In general, what are the things you try
to teach these students?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mostly we aren&rsquo;t there to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; them so much as let them get a
feel for a real-world project. What it&rsquo;s like to design, document, code
and test an application. With only 1 semester it&rsquo;s tough to do but it&rsquo;s
still a good experience for all.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which part of the ASP.NET framework
would you enjoy talking about?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I have the advantage of being with Asp.Net since it&rsquo;s pre-beta days. At
an early MVP summit the Asp MVPs (there was no Asp.Net at the time) were
taken in to a lab at Microsoft and allowed to play with the &ldquo;bits&rdquo; that
later became Asp.Net 1.0. It blew us all away. Prebuilt controls,
compiled code, object oriented programming and an intellisense
development environment&hellip; WOW. It was like the computer Gods took a
liking to us and blessed us with their favor. Most of us at the time
were dealing with pure scripting and using tools like notepad for our
development environment so there really didn&rsquo;t have to be a huge leap
for us to feel like we really gained ground but this was really a lot
more than we hoped for.<br>
Now that I gave you my background in Asp.Net&hellip; you can see it would be
hard to limit myself on what to talk about. I&rsquo;ve really worked at it
over the years, staying up to date as much as I can, but I have to be
honest and say that a lot of the developments/enhancements that have
come out in the last year have really passed right by me. LINQ, MVC,
DynamicData just to name a few&hellip; these things I can&rsquo;t really talk on
with any strong knowledge. I&rsquo;ve messed around with them, and used them a
little and can see how they could really help but I&rsquo;m an old-school
developer. Taking away too much control is something that&rsquo;s a little
scary. Anyway&hellip; feel free to ask on anything you would like. If it&rsquo;s a
topic I haven&rsquo;t gotten to know well then I&rsquo;ll say so.<br>
Oh, and I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ve mentioned but I&rsquo;ve done a ton of manuscript
reviews for publishers. I&rsquo;m quoted on a few covers from Manning press
(Asp.Net Ajax in Action and WPF In Action) as well as being listed in
the acknowledgements sections of quite a few books related to
programming.</p>

of this interview which will be published next week Tuesday I
think.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
