<p>Since I&rsquo;m a consultant I have to go with the specifications of my
clients. Most still use stored procedures though I see a shift
occurring. My current client allows us to use Linq To Sql for select
statements (generated by L2S) but for update, delete and insert
statements they require us to make sprocs since they put security on
it on a database level. My former client allowed us to use NHibernate
(winforms project) but for 3-4 special occasions we used sprocs.</p>

<p>I do use Stored Procedures on a regular basis. I develop mostly in
DotNetNuke, which has an extensive use of stored procs. I have read
blogs, and forum posts that suggest that stored procedures shouldn&rsquo;t
be used as they can be a performance bottleneck, but I believe they
are an excellent way of promoting SQL Abstraction. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do however try to preserve the number of stored procedures I write.
I normally create one stored procedure to handle both insert and
updates to the a particular table, one for deleting, and one to select
(sometimes i do multiple select statements within one stored proc if
it makes sense). </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To work away from bottlenecks, i try to use subqueries in my stored
procedures instead of using a view to query against. unless of course
a view is more efficient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not much a case of would I use stored procedures as when would I
not use them! Occasionally for searching, dynamic TSQL needs to be
generated and for this I would use parameterized TSQL. Otherwise I use
stored procedures all the time. I do have stored procedures for
generating from the table definition stored procedures plus wrapper
code. This allows very rapid development of the data layer.</p>
<p>The use of stored procedures (or the occasional parameterized TSQL) is
in my opinion one of a series of essential steps to produce robust
applications.</p>

<p>I prefer to (read <em>always</em>) use stored procedures when I’m developing
front end applications. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ones who find creating stored procedures is intolerable overhead,
I want to give some advantages.. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>They are modular, I’d prefer to troubleshoot a stored procedure
than an embedded query buried within many lines of GUI code.</li>
<li>They are tunable. Changes can be made to the stored procedures
&ndash;in terms of join methods, differing tables, etc.&ndash; that are
transparent to the front-end interface.</li>
<li>Stored procedures abstract or separate server-side functions from
the client-side. It is much easier to code a GUI application to
call a procedure than to build a query through the GUI code.</li>
<li>Stored procedures are usually written by database
developers/administrators. Persons holding these roles are usually
more experienced in writing efficient queries and SQL statements.
This frees the GUI application developers to utilize their skills
on the functional and graphical presentation pieces of the
application. If you have your people performing the tasks to which
they are best suited, then you will ultimately produce a better
overall application.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, queries are best handled via stored procedures. While the
initial development overhead is greater, you will more than make up
for the investment down the line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like a lot of people are still very fond of stored procedures. The
arguments make a lot of sense!</p>
