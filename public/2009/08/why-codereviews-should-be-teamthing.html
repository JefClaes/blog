<h3 id="my-arguments">My arguments</h3>
<ol>
<li>Having all developers do code reviews leads to discussions about what coding standards should be used..</li>
<li>Leading to well-documented standards.</li>
<li>Each developer is forced to understand the workflow of an application which isn&rsquo;t his, which expands his domain knowledge.</li>
<li>Each developer learns from others and is given an opportunity to teach and discuss why someone chose a certain path.. There is always     something new to learn, even for seasoned developers. You might just pick up that latest trick doing whizbang Silverlight 3 stuff from that freshman that just started working this year.</li>
<li>Multiple perspectives on a problem can only benefit the solution.</li>
