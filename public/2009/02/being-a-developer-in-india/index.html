<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quite bad..</p>
<ol>
<li>You get into heavy competition from day one when you join a Computer
Science course.</li>
<li>Companies set percentage criteria for young graduates. If you are
below those criteria you will have a hard time finding a job.</li>
<li>If you get into the company, the company decides what you will work
on.</li>
<li>For Multinationals you need to pay security amount which is refunded
when you complete a certain period in the company the period has a
range 1-4 years depending on the company.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How do you make up for the lack of
experience? Work harder, be more passionate, &hellip;?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In Multinationals you can&rsquo;t be more passionate because you have a lot of
restrictions. But you get a fair amount of money too. In Midsized and
smaller companies, you&rsquo;ll get good work but at the cost of less money.
But here too you can&rsquo;t be passionate since the Team Leaders and Project
Managers mostly don&rsquo;t allow you to do so. So it&rsquo;s the company which
decides much rather than the individual. It&rsquo;s very rare that you get
into a company that allows you to use ideas like mine.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is the general feeling about
outsourcing? Is everyone just content that it is great for the economy,
or do people have doubts?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It has increased the IT in India and many companies take up
outsourced work from other countries. Recently the recession affected
many companies and they have removed many employees. So it has both
positive and negative effects.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you think India is a threat to
Europe? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I have no idea in that perspective.</p>
