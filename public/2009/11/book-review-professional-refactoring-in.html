				<p>Three months ago I was looking up to refactoring a legacy ASP.NET
Webforms application. Although I was familiar with refactoring, I
ordered &ldquo;Professional Refactoring in C# &amp; ASP.NET&rdquo; by Daniejel
Arsenovski to get deeper into refactoring.</p>
<h3 id="the-title">The title</h3>
<p>Although the title states &ldquo;Professional&rdquo;, I think this book should find
its main audience in coding novices. Another problem with the title is
the word ASP.NET in it. The book has one chapter covering ASP.NET, with
only 35 poor-quality pages in it.</p>
<p>Now the title has some issues, but how was the content?</p>
<h3 id="the-content">The content</h3>
<p>Danijel identifies codes mells and shows refactoring techniques to solve
them. Too bad some of these examples are spreaded over multiple pages,
which makes them a tad sloppy and hard to read. Danijel stresses how
important Object Oriented design is. He proves this by transforming
procedural code into Object Oriented code, greatly improving the
readability. This book should help developers who are new to or come
from a non-OO background to apply the basic Object Oriented concepts.
Next to refactoring techniques, he also touches refactoring tools, unit
testing and design patterns.</p>
<p>I think the beginning .NET developer might be able to significally start
improving his codebase by reading this book. For more experienced .NET
developers most of the topics handled in the book should be part of
their day-to-day skillset.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All by all I was a bit dissapointed by the book, it was an easy read,
had a few interesting tricks, but I expected it would go more into
depth.</p>
<p>Something valuable I realised though.. <strong>is that refactoring isn&rsquo;t something you learn
by reading a book, but you learn it by obeying the constant hunger for
improving your code.</strong></p>
<p>If you feel confident that you dig the basic concepts of writing quality
code, I would instead of buying this book, invest in a good book on
Object Oriented concepts or design patterns.</p>
