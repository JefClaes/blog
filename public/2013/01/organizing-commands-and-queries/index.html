				<p>In the last few posts I settled on an architecture for handling commands
and queries. A byproduct of <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/01/separating-command-data-from-logic-and.html">the described
approach</a>,
is that your codebase quickly racks up plentiful little classes; a class
to hold data, and a handler to act on that data, for each use case.</p>
<p>There are a few ways you can go at organizing things.</p>
<p><strong>Everything in one location</strong><br>
**<br>
**When there is very little going on in your application, you can just
dump everything in one location without getting hurt too much.<br>
**<br>
**</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2013-01-27-organizing-commands-and-queries-DumpedEverything.PNG"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2013-01-27-organizing-commands-and-queries-DumpedEverything.PNG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Folder per functionality**<br>
**<br>
**When your application grows, and the coherency between different use
cases are obvious, you can just use folders - and corresponding
namespaces, to organize your commands and queries, and to draw their
functional boundaries. Uncle Bob and Mark Needham have <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/02/20/coding-packaging-by-vertical-slice/">sold me on
structuring my code based on functionality instead of technical
concepts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2013-01-27-organizing-commands-and-queries-PerFolder.PNG"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2013-01-27-organizing-commands-and-queries-PerFolder.PNG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Keeping each commandhandler in a separate class is especially
interesting when they are rather bulky and contain a good amount of
logic. You can think of each class as a little piece of functionality in
itself. <a href="https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb/tree/master/Raven.Studio/Commands">Take a look at the RavenDB
codebase</a>
to get an idea of what that could look like.</p>
<p>It also feels like this way tends to bring your code closer to the
Solution Explorer; just one double-click and you are looking at your
implementation; no scrolling or searching between method definitions
necessary. Maybe the problem is now just shifted a level higher in the
hierarchy though.</p>
<p><strong>Composing a service class</strong><br>
**<br>
**You can also opt to group commandhandler implementations in one
service class. This variation might make more sense when your
implementations are rather skinny, and don&rsquo;t do a whole lot but
translating and forwarding your invocation.</p>
<pre><code>public class SubscriptionService : 
        ICommandHandler&lt;SubscribeCommand&gt;,
        ICommandHandler&lt;UnsubscribeCommand&gt;
{
    public void Handle(SubscibeCommand command)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public void Handle(UnsubscribeCommand command)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Use the hints your dependency graph gives you to find a composition that
makes sense.</p>
