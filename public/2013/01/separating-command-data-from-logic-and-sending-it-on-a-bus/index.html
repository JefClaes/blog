				<p>In <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/10/commands-queries-and-testing.html">my first post on this
topic</a>,
I started out with an attempt to limit abstractions to solely commands
and queries. Commands and queries were self-contained and could be
invoked by passing them to a context-providing generic handler. The
drawback of this approach was that it made constructor dependency
injection impossible. In a <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/10/commands-with-dependencies.html">next
post</a>, I
separated data from logic, but never got around to writing a dispatcher
that associates command data with their handlers. Last week, <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/01/self-contained-commands-with.html">I
revisited the first
approach</a>,
and added an unconventional implementation of injecting dependencies by
an Inject method convention.</p>
<p>I still believe that last approach is very simple and works fine if
extra dependencies are exceptional. I do admit that it will make
architectural shoots harder to handle; everything is rather tightly
coupled. So let&rsquo;s look at an alternative architecture which pulls all
the bits apart, and should be better equipped to handle change.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first separate command data from logic.</p>
<pre><code>public class CreateSubscriptionCommand 
{     
    public CreateSubscriptionCommand(string value, string category, string emailAddress)
    {
        Guard.StringIsNullOrEmpty(value, &quot;value&quot;);
        Guard.StringIsNullOrEmpty(category, &quot;category&quot;);
        Guard.StringIsNullOrEmpty(emailAddress, &quot;emailAddress&quot;);

        Value = value;
        Category = category;
        EmailAddress = emailAddress;
    }

    public string Value { get; private set; }

    public string Category { get; private set; }

    public string EmailAddress { get; private set; }

    public override bool Equals(Object other)
    {
        if (other == null)
            return false;

        var otherCommand = other as CreateSubscriptionCommand;
        if (otherCommand == null)
            return false;

        return otherCommand.Value == Value &amp;&amp; 
            otherCommand.Category == Category &amp;&amp; 
            otherCommand.EmailAddress == EmailAddress;
    }    

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return Value.GetHashCode() ^ 
            Category.GetHashCode() ^ 
            EmailAddress.GetHashCode();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The data is just a POCO. Notice the equality overrides; this comes in
handy when you&rsquo;re testing.</p>
<p>The class that handles on the data needs to implement the
ICommandHandler interface.</p>
<pre><code>public class CreateSubscriptionCommandHandler 
    : ICommandHandler&lt;CreateSubscriptionCommand&gt;
{    
    private IDocumentSession _session;

    public CreateSubscriptionCommandHandler(IDocumentSession session)
    {
        _session = session;
    }

    public void Handle(CreateSubscriptionCommand command)
    {
        var subscription = new Documents.Subscription(
            command.Value, command.Category, command.EmailAddress);

        _session.Store(subscription);    
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compared to the previous approach, we&rsquo;re now injecting the session
instead of having it handy as a property; that coupling is now
completely gone.</p>
<p>Last thing left to do is create an interface that consumers can use to
send commands on: a bus.</p>
<pre><code>public class Bus : IBus
{
    private readonly IKernel _kernel;
    private readonly IDocumentSession _session;

    public Bus(IKernel kernel, IDocumentSession session)
    {
        _kernel = kernel;
        _session = session;
    }

    public void ExecuteCommand&lt;T&gt;(T command) where T : class
    {
        var handler = _kernel.Get&lt;ICommandHandler&lt;T&gt;&gt;();

        handler.Handle(command);

        _session.SaveChanges();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The ExecuteCommand method dispatches data to the correct handler by
resolving it from the container, and also commits the unit of work.</p>
<p>The consumer can execute commands like this.</p>
<pre><code>bus.ExecuteCommand(
    new CreateQueryCommand(queryValue, category, emailAddress));
</code></pre>
<p>With this approach having all the bits spread, we have a bit more work
gluing all the pieces together. The session is now known in the
container, and is request scoped. The commandhandlers are also all
registered in the container.</p>
<pre><code>protected override void ConfigureRequestContainer(IKernel container, NancyContext context)
{        
        // you don't want to register them all individually
        container
            .Bind&lt;ICommandHandler&lt;CreateSubscriptionCommand&gt;&gt;()
            .To&lt;CreateSubscriptionCommandHandler&gt;();        
        // snip..
        container.Bind&lt;IDocumentSession&gt;()
            .ToMethod((ctx) =&gt; { 
                return ctx.Kernel.Get&lt;IDocumentStore&gt;().OpenSession();    
            })
            .InSingletonScope();                          
}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this approach might suit a lot of projects better if your
commands are dependency heavy.<br>
What I like most is that handling architectural shoots will be easier.
For example: right now, all behaviour is in my entities and in my
commands; the segregation of application services and domain services is
non-existent. And this works fine so far; I yet have to find a use case
where I would benefit from more separation. If that would change in the
future though, I can introduce abstractions, and concepts, without
breaking consumer code, and without having to do awkward stuff managing
the newly introduced dependencies.</p>
<p><em>As always, your thoughts are appreciated.</em></p>
