<p>Today we followed the advice of the kind lady at the visitor center and
hiked along Calfs Creek. It was a 6 miles (10km) round trip through
loose sand in over 100°F (38°C), but halfway you’re rewarded with a
stunningly beautiful waterfall and a refreshing dip in the basin.
Driving up there, we got to witness the grandeur of the Utah plateau.
When we finally got back to the air conditioned car, we made a detour to
see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Staircase-Escalante_National_Monument">Grand Staircase – Escalante National
Monument</a>.</p>
