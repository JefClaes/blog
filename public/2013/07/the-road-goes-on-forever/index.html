				<p>We didn’t get to see a lot of Salt Lake City. Before heading to Idaho
Falls, we hung around at the mall, feasted on Sushi, and bought new
hiking shoes since ours literally fell apart.<br>
Since Idaho Falls just served as a launching point to Yellowstone, we
filled the hole in our schedule with a date night; we had BBQ and went
to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z_(film)">WorldWar Z</a>.</p>
<p>After another long drive the next day, we exchanged the dirt for greener
scenery. We drove through Grand Teton, to get to of one our last and
most anticipated destinations; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park">Yellowstone National
Park</a>. We spent
two days here, in which we drove across the extensive volcanic area,
stopping at all popular attractions (geysers, pools, waterfalls…),
spotting and stalking wildlife on the way. </p>
<p>Instead of a motel, we slept in the wild - in bear country, in a Tipi.
Although our host armed us with bear spray, we got a good night’s sleep.
Today however, we did spot a baby Grizzly bear from afar!</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be our last day, which we will spend in Cody, Wyoming.</p>
