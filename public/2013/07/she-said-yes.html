				<p>Since our stay in Vegas was rather short, we selected some things <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas.html">we
failed to do last
time</a>.
For me, shooting a gun was definitely on that list. Although I&rsquo;m not
that big on gun culture - seems to me that if you live by the gun,
you&rsquo;re more likely to die by the gun - it&rsquo;s still a thrill holding such
a powerful weapon. We headed to Vegas&rsquo;s most popular shooting range: The
Gun Store. At the entrance, I got to pick a gun and a target to point it
at. The heavy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMI_Desert_Eagle">Desert
Eagle</a> became my weapon
of choice to blow a zombie&rsquo;s head off. Being guided to the shooting
range by a professional, he ensured that I didn&rsquo;t shoot my foot, and
helped me land five headshots.Â </p>

<p>In the evening we got a players card hoping Lady Luck would bend
variance to our benefit for once - those hopes were in vain. It didn&rsquo;t
take too long before we busted our 20$ gambling budget on virtual Poker.
It earned us a free buffet though. We decided to drown our losses at the
lounge with beer and cocktails.</p>
<p>Checking out late, we set out for <a href="http://www.nps.gov/cebr/index.htm">Cedar Breaks National
Monument</a>. We waited till the evening
to drive up because we were hoping for a clear night sky to do some
stargazing. When we drove off, it was pouring rain, so things weren&rsquo;t
looking up. Reaching the top of the mountain, skies cleared up and a
rainbow appeared. There we were, just the two of us, standing on top of
the world. Finally, after an overcrowded observatory and barely making
the 4th of July fireworks, I got to complete my quest and be freed of
the one ring that had been burning in my backpack for over a week. I
went down on one knee and asked my girlfriend of seven years to marry
me. And she said yes!<br>
We spent the rest of our evening looking at the impressive stellar sky
as a happy newly engaged couple.</p>
