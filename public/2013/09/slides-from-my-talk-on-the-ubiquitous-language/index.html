				<p>I just returned from our yearly <a href="http://euri.com/">Euricom</a> retreat.
This year, all forty of us got to spend four days in the South of Spain.
Where we had longish sessions and a few workshops last year, we
experimented with shorter talks this year - a la lightning talks, TEDx
style.</p>
<p>This format made it possible for everyone to speak, but also forced the
speaker to keep the scope of the talk focused, and to organize the
information in a way that attendees can get the gist of it in only
twelve minutes. This makes for high-energy talks designed to peak one&rsquo;s
interest, to share useful tips, to plant a seed or to pitch an idea.<br>
Covering more than just technical ground alone made topics extremely
diverse; from query tuning to empathy, from automated testing to how to
explain your kids what you do for a living, from personal kanban to
juggling with a diabolo. Going back and forth between these technical
and less technical sessions kept my brain from being oversaturated.</p>
<p>Definitely an experiment that only yielded positive results; we will be
using this format more frequently when organizing internal events.</p>
<p>Initially, I planned on doing a session on the DDD strategic patterns;
the ubiquitous language, subdomains, bounded contexts, context
mapping&hellip; but I couldn&rsquo;t capture all of that in a meaningful way in
less than twelve minutes. That&rsquo;s why I started over, focusing on the
ubiquitous language alone.</p>
