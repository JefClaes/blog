				<p>Last night, I returned from Vilnius, after seven intensive days of
<a href="http://buildstuff.lt/">Buildstuff</a>. After a few long months, I was
looking forward to be influenced and inspired by concepts and
experiences strange to my day-to-day job - surrounded by people hungry
to build better software. Because of the diversity of the program, the
high level of the speakers and the presence of some familiar
DDD-community faces, my expectations were easily met. Also, the location
and low rates for tickets, transport and beer make it a very reasonable
investment.</p>
<p>I expect the videos to be uploaded over the next few weeks and thus I
will not bore you with session summaries. Instead I picked out some
quotes which stood out for me in one way or the other; because they were
spot on, summarize a concept in just a few words, or because they
challenge me and give me food for thought.</p>
<p>Hope to see you again next year, Buildstuff.</p>
