				<p>I learned all about logical design of relational databases back in
school; tables, columns, data types, views, normalization, constraints,
primary keys, foreign keys&hellip; At the same time, I learned how to use SQL
to put data in, and how to get it out again; <code>INSERT INTO, SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP...</code></p>
<p>In the first project I worked on just out of school, we weren&rsquo;t doing
anything interesting with databases; we didn&rsquo;t have that many users, or
that much data. A database veteran on the team took it on him to
maintain the schema and to provide stored procedures we could do work
with.</p>
<p>All that time, I consciously was very ignorant of the database. I had no
idea what was in the box, and I didn&rsquo;t care either; databases were
boring, applications were where the fun was at.</p>
<p>Since then, I have rarely worked with a team that had a dedicated role
for database design. Why invest in another person when you can do
without? Database basics are not rocket science; with 20% of the
knowledge, you get very far. Definitely now that it&rsquo;s probably easier
and cheaper to throw hardware at the problem.</p>
<p>That being said, it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep a DBA close. Time and time
again I see them only being called in when it&rsquo;s too late and much needed
improvements are often too far-reaching and expensive. No wonder DBA&rsquo;s
are grumpy all the time.</p>
<p>Being exposed to databases more and more, I got to pick up a few things
here and there - mostly cargo-cult best practices. It wasn&rsquo;t until last
year that I got really curious for what was in the box. Working on an
application with a decent amount of data crunching for a year forced me
to open up the lid. Also my ventures in NoSQL land, overhearing
discussions on Twitter between
<a href="https://twitter.com/kellabyte">kellabyte</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/ayende">ayende</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/gregyoung">gregyoung</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pbailis">pbailis</a> and
others had much to do with it.</p>
<p>On opening the lid, I found a lot more than I expected. It had never
occurred to me how much interesting problems databases have to solve.
Making a database execute a query and see results returned in
milliseconds only looks easy on the surface. Memory, disk, CPU, caching,
networking, protocols, concurrency, fault tolerance, data structures,
transactions, compilation&hellip; it&rsquo;s all in there.</p>
<p>The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123693896/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0123693896&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=diofanedebyje-20">Physical Database
Design</a>
and the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/docs.html">SQLite technical
documentation</a> were the first good
reads that helped me understand what was going on closer to the metal.
From there, I now try reading a paper (or a reference) from the
<a href="http://redbook.cs.berkeley.edu/bib4.html">Readings in Database Systems</a>
collection once in a while. This collection of papers is supposed to
contain the most important papers in database research. Maybe academic,
but delicious brain food nonetheless - stretching my mind in ways I&rsquo;m
not used to.</p>
