				<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying event sourcing from a distance for little over a year
now; reading online material and going through some of the excellent OS
code. Unfortunately, there would be no value introducing it into my
current project - it would even be a terrible idea, so I decided to
satisfy my inquisitiveness by consolidating and sharing my understanding
of the concept.</p>
<h3 id="domain-events">Domain events</h3>
<p>An event is something that happened in the past.</p>
<p>Events are described as verbs in the past tense. For example; amount
withdrawn, amount deposited, maximum withdrawal amount exceeded. Listen
for them when talking to your domain experts; events are as much a part
of the ubiquitous language as commands, aggregates, value objects
etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve captured a few events, you will notice how these concepts
have always implicitly been there, but by making them explicit you
introduce a whole new set of power tools to work with.</p>
<h3 id="event-sourcing">Event sourcing</h3>
<p>Having defined domain events one more time, we can now look at event
sourcing. By the name alone, it should be obvious events are going to
play the lead role.</p>
<p>In traditional systems, we only persist the current state of an object.
In event sourced systems, we don&rsquo;t persist the current state of an
object, but the <strong>sequence of events</strong> that caused the object to be in
the current state.</p>
<p>In traditional systems, every time a change happens, we retrieve the old
state, mutate it, and store the result as our current state. In this
example, only the last column would be persisted.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">Old amount      Command         Current amount
                CreateAccount   $0
$0	            Deposit $2000	$2000
$2000	        Withdraw $100	$1900
$1900	        Withdraw $500	$1400
$1400	        Withdraw $2000	$1400
$1400	        Withdraw $300	$1100
</code></pre></div><p>In event sourced systems on the other hand, we store the changes that
happened - the second column, not the current state. To arrive at the
current state again, we take all these events - and replay them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">Command	        Event	                                Current amount
CreateAccount	AccountCreated	                        $0
Deposit $2000	Deposited $2000	                        $2000
Withdraw $100	Withdrawn $100	                        $1900
Withdraw $500	Withdrawn $500	                        $1400
Withdraw $2000	Maximum withdrawal amount exceeded! 	$1400
Withdraw $300	Withdrawn $300	                        $1100
</code></pre></div><p>Notice how we already gain better insights into what&rsquo;s happening by
seeing an explicit <em>maximum amount exceeded</em> event.</p>
<p><em>Next time; what does this look like in code?</em></p>
