				<p>In my first two posts on event sourcing, I implemented <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/10/an-event-sourced-aggregate.html">an event sourced
aggregate from
scratch</a>.
After being able to have an aggregate record and play events, I looked
at persisting them in <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/10/an-event-store.html">an event
store</a>. Logically,
the next question is: how do I query my aggregates, how do I get my
state out?</p>
<p>In traditional systems, write and read models are not separated, they
are one and the same. Event sourced systems on the other hand have a
write model - event streams, and a separate read model. The read model
is built from events committed to the write model; events are projected
into one or more read models.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>One could argue that all of this is too much - not worth the effort.
Where you first just persisted the structure of an aggregate, and could
query that same structure, you now first have to persist events for then
to write projections that maintain separate read models that can be
queried.</p>
<p>You have to look beyond that though. Those that have done any serious
work on a traditional stack have felt the pain of migrations, complex
queries that take up three pages, obscure stored procedures that run for
hours, optimizing while having to consider a handful of different use
cases, finding the balance between write- and read performance, database
servers that can&rsquo;t handle the load on special events, expensive licenses
and so on. While these first few concerns are mostly technical,
personally I&rsquo;m often overwhelmed by how much concepts these designs
force you to keep in your head all at once.</p>
<p>Separating reads from writes using event sourcing might bring some
relief. Reducing cognitive overload by separating responsibilities into
smaller, more granular bits might be the only argument you need.
However, there&rsquo;s a lot more. Running an event store should be
low-maintenance; it&rsquo;s an append-only data model storing simple
serialized DTO&rsquo;s with some meta data - forget about big migrations (not
completely though), schemas, indexes and so on. Even if you project into
a relational database, being able to re-run projections should make
migration scripts and versioning avoidable. An event can be projected
into multiple read models, allowing you to optimize per use case,
without having to take other use cases into account. Since it should be
easy to rebuild read models, they can be stored in cheap and volatile
storage - think key-value store, in-memory and so on, allowing for crazy
fast reads.</p>
<p>Letting go of the single-model dogma seems to enable so much more,
giving you a whole new set of possibilities. Another extremely useful
use case that suddenly becomes a lot easier to support is business
intelligence; when business experts think of new ways to look at the
past, you just create a new projection and project events from day one.
Getting statistics of how your users are using your system doesn&rsquo;t sound
that hard now, does it?</p>
<p>One of the obvious drawbacks next to writing a bit more, boring code is
that storage costs will increase - you are now persisting the same data
in multiple representations. But storage is cheap, right? Maybe money
isn&rsquo;t an issue, but what about performance? It&rsquo;s slower to do three
writes instead of one, right? For a lot of scenarios this won&rsquo;t be much
of an issue, but if it is, there is a lot of room for optimiziations
doing projections; parallelization, eventual consistency and so on.</p>
