				<p>Somewhere over a year and a half ago I discovered the music of Dire
Straits, which has sparked a fanatical love and fascination for the
guitar in me, and basically for every piece of music <a href="http://www.markknopfler.com/">Mark
Knopfler</a> has ever touched (*). A year
ago, I finally had the courage to pick up the guitar myself. Not sure if
I&rsquo;d stick with it, I made an uninformed purchase of a rather inexpensive
Squier Jazzmaster, just because it somewhat resembled the real object of
desire, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Stratocaster">Fender
Stratocaster</a>. Three
months ago, I got rid of the Jazzmaster, and bought myself a tango red
Mexican Stratocaster, and I&rsquo;m in love with it. Yet, I have also become
very fond of the sound of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Les_Paul">Les
Paul</a> these days. Having
just bought the Strat, I thought I could maybe find a cheap used Les
Paul online.</p>
<p>I set out to find one on <a href="http://www.2dehands.be/">the most popular Belgian online secondhand
marketplace<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
(600k visitors daily), so I started browsing their listings daily. This
turned out to be rather cumbersome and inefficient: constantly repeating
the same process, items were already sold before I could make a bid,
there were no new items since the last time I visited&hellip; It didn&rsquo;t take
me long before I started thinking of a way to automate this dull
process. Looking at other marketplaces, I found that some unburden their
users by providing notifications; push instead of pull. Maybe I could
build something similar?</p>
<p>Doing a bit of research over the weekend, I found out that they expose,
what I call, an <em>accidental</em> API; written in first place to provide a
snappy mobile user experience, not to expose all their data to third
parties. Having an uncomplicated way of searching their data, I built a
bit of code on top of it. Nothing all too fancy though; a <a href="http://quartznet.sourceforge.net/">Quartz
job</a> which periodically queries their
service, parses the results and stores them in a
<a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a> database. A few times a day, these search
results are then compiled, and sent to my inbox using
<a href="http://www.mailgun.com/">MailGun</a>. All of this running for free on
<a href="https://appharbor.com/">AppHarbor</a>.</p>
<p>Showing all of this to the girlfriend, she asked if I could set up the
same thing for her, but then for a specific type of camera. This is when
I decided it could be useful enough to make it publicly available. I
thought of a few ways to support the costs of hosting (which are
extremely low): embed ridiculously relevant ads in the mails, make
people pay for more frequent polling, or sell it (although very
unlikely).</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I had something working online.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2013-02-24-my-christmas-holiday-project-postmortem-tweedehandsmeldingen.PNG"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2013-02-24-my-christmas-holiday-project-postmortem-tweedehandsmeldingen.PNG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>But how do I inform people of its existence? I first thought of using
Twitter to monitor for relevant tweets where people ask for something
secondhand. I started out by using a new dedicated generic account, but
this got suspended rather quickly. In the second iteration, I used my
personal account. This yielded better results; people saw I was human,
and regularly thanked me for the tip. They didn&rsquo;t sign up too often
though..</p>
<p>Not willing to give up on the idea already, I used Google Adwords to
advertise on the online marketplace directly. The results of this
campaign were sobering, but extremely valuable; people just didn&rsquo;t care.
As a side note; secondhand seems to be quite an expensive keyword!</p>

<p>In hindsight, I can think of plenty of reasons why this somewhat useful
project has no success:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem it is trying to solve obviously isn&rsquo;t enough of a pain!</li>
<li>People don&rsquo;t Google for it, and even if they did, this site had
hardly any chance in making it to the first page.</li>
<li>In general the secondhand offering is enormous, and people often
quickly settle for less.</li>
<li>Specialized markets aren&rsquo;t situated on these sites. </li>
<li>People don&rsquo;t like giving away their email address, definitely not to
strangers they don&rsquo;t trust. </li>
<li>Everyone struggles to keep their inboxes clean, receiving mail puts
off people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Damn, it&rsquo;s always evident in hindsight.</p>
<p>Here are a few things I learned/got confirmed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being your own customer is priceless; you know exactly where the
value is at.</li>
<li>Chances are you will never see a user; don&rsquo;t spend too much time
optimizing for scalability and reliability.</li>
<li>Some Google ads plus a website with a simple form can be enough to
let you cheaply validate the worthiness of pursuing an idea.</li>
</ul>
