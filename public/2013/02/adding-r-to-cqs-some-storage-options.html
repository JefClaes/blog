<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">CQS</a> (or
command and query separation) lately. In <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/02/raising-events-in-commandhandlers.html">my last post on using

I already hinted towards bringing in the R; command and query
<strong>r</strong>esponsibility separation.</p>
<p>With CQS, commands can mutate data, while queries can only read that
data. CQRS takes this one step further, and assigns commands and queries
each a dedicated model; we now talk of a write side, and a read side.</p>
<p>I like <a href="https://twitter.com/clemensv">Clemens Vasters</a> definition
best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CQRS is a simple pattern that strictly segregates the responsibility
of handling command input into an autonomous system from the
responsibility of handling side-effect-free query/read access on the
same system. Consequently, the decoupling allows for any number of
homogeneous or heterogeneous query/read modules to be paired with a
command processor. This principle presents a very suitable foundation
for event sourcing, eventual-consistency state replication/fan-out
and,  thus, high-scale read access. In simple terms, you don’t service
queries via the same module of a service that you process commands
through. In REST terminology, GET requests wire up to a different
thing from what PUT, POST, and DELETE requests wire up to. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A nice drawing also helps in understanding CQRS (from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj591573">the CQRS journey
material</a>).</p>

<p>Although scalability seems to be one of the big selling points of CQRS,
there are still some valid arguments applicable to my world; the
strongest one being able to avoid the discrepancy which exists while you
use the same model for reading and writing. I think everyone suffers
from this one regularly. A popular and realistic example is this one; an
ORM is used to map our domain model to a relational database, the tables
are mapped very closely to the structure of the domain model. Not long
after, it becomes evident that it&rsquo;s impossible to write simple and
performant queries targeting this datastructure. We could optimize for
reads, but this would impact the complexity and performance of writing.
With CQRS, reads and writes are segregated; we can now optimize both
parts independently. And this doesn&rsquo;t only result in being able to show
a list faster on a user&rsquo;s screen, but interesting things can also be
done to empower reporting and data mining; think of how often using the
same database for these tasks makes it hard and expensive to change
things.</p>
<p>While I still have done very little with CQRS, I have been looking at
more and more real world examples, trying to fill in the blanks. What
always has been kind of vague to me, is how you go at storing your
domain model, and your read models <em>in practice</em>. Here are a few
possible techniques - these are some proven techniques, and partially my
own presumptions (you hardly find any OSS brown field examples).</p>
<h3 id="the-compromise">The compromise</h3>
<p>CQRS doesn&rsquo;t have to be an application-wide architecture necessarily;
nothing stops you from introducing it gently, and just applying it to
parts of your application where the added value is over-obvious. This
could mean that you use a conventional architecture; a relational
database with an ORM, or a document store, not distinguishing the write
side from the read side. Yet for certain scenarios, you could introduce
a specialized read or write side. For example; update the statistics
read model on every relevant write, update a denormalized optimized read
model for searches, etc..</p>
<h3 id="norm">NORM</h3>
<p>While the relational paradigm definitely has its place, mapping your
domain to the database can get complex, and require much maintenance. If
you don&rsquo;t expect of your write side to be queryable, you can take
advantage of less cumbersome techniques such as a key value store to
store your domain model. This does force you to completely separate
reads from writes though.</p>
<h3 id="event-sourcing">Event Sourcing</h3>
<p>When you look at most OSS CQRS implementations, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event
Sourcing</a> and CQRS go
hand in hand. With Event Sourcing, you capture all application state
changes as a sequence of events. I&rsquo;m really fond of the theory behind
this pattern, and I can imagine the added operational value of having a
log of each change. Yet, I also think you could largely achieve the same
result by enabling journaling and adding some interception. Storage
wise, you store all the event streams in an event store, which is
optimized for such a task. Your read side can again be whatever you
fancy.</p>
<p>These three techniques aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive. There are a bunch of
arguments to consider, and everything is highly dependent on your
technical and operational requirements.</p>
<p>What is your experience with CQRS? Which techniques have you applied <em>in
practice</em>?</p>
