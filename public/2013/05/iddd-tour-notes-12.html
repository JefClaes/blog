I had high hopes for this course. I anticipated a week of getting
lectured on DDD with a few practical exercises, but was blown away by
the openness and interaction promoted by Vaughn and his associate
<a href="https://twitter.com/ziobrando">Alberto Brandolini</a>. A passionate group,
engaging workshops, long days and lots of sharing made these few days
exceptionally satisfying and inspirational. I&rsquo;m grateful to those who
got this show on the road; it was more than worth your trouble.</p>
<p>Over these few days I scribbled down some things I thought were worth
remembering or worth some more thought. Most of these are aimed at the
strategic side of DDD and the softer side of software since that&rsquo;s where
I acquired most new insights.</p>
<h3 id="complexity">Complexity</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If we really understood the complexity of a system, we would very
often make different decisions from when designing new systems. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the complexity of a new system is hard. Modeling can serve
as the perfect tool to help you expose the hidden complexities as early
as possible.<br>
Often a system appears to be not much more than CRUD, to quickly evolve
into something with a lot more behaviour than anticipated. Make sure you
don&rsquo;t sabotage growing your design by picking an architecture or
framework that doesn&rsquo;t allow you to.<br>
I often start with just exposing commands and queries to my application,
which encapsulate all domain logic. Behind these command- and
queryhandlers is very little abstraction, just some basic building
blocks; aggregates, entities and value objects. Later on I can
relentlessly refactor everything behind these commands and queries
without breaking application code: introduce domain services, events,
separate the write- from the read model etc&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="change">Change</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you bring in DDD? Gather a small cluster of motivated silent
people and work on a project that has lots of potential value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is my recipe for change as well. Find a few like-minded people that
are confident drawing outside the lines set out by the status quo, work
in the shades, working your way towards the light.</p>
<h3 id="brown">Brown</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There is always brown, even when it&rsquo;s under the green. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every application has parts which are less pretty, even green fields;
use proper encapsulation to contain them, and avoid them corrupting
other parts of the system.</p>
<h3 id="another-brick-in-the-wall">Another brick in the wall</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Break down that paper wall between domain experts and developers.
Learn the favorite coffee of the domain expert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lots of organizations still build this paper wall between domain experts
and developers. But paper doesn&rsquo;t answer to questions, nor does it carry
nuances very well. Communicating on a more personal level is key to
tearing down that wall. Breaking the ice can be as easy as treating your
domain expert to coffee.</p>
<h3 id="one-language">One language</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Which language do you use when naming things in code? Yours. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think native English speakers understand just how awkward it is
to write code in something other than English. Keywords, API&rsquo;s,
documentation&hellip; it&rsquo;s all in English. I feel that putting these together
with your own language results in a cacophony of words.<br>
In my current project the business is bilingual; they use Dutch and
French names for the same concept interchangeably. We tried to find
middle ground by introducing English names, and have a map between these
languages. Ideally there would only be one language though.<br>
Someone mentioned that they use English for all globally unambiguous
concepts such as account number, name&hellip; but use their mother tongue in
scenarios where nuances would be lost in translation. This seems to be
an attractive compromise.</p>
<h3 id="defining-a-bounded-context">Defining a bounded context</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A bounded context is where one ubiquitous language is consistent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is by far the simplest definition of a bounded context. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="bounded-context-relations">Bounded context relations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You say please, so I am upstream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/03/30/ddd-recognising-relationships-between-bounded-contexts/">relationship between bounded
contexts</a>
is expressed by saying one is upstream or downstream. I thought of the
quote above to be a creative expression that can aid in explaining these
two concepts.</p>
<h3 id="rewrites">Rewrites</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When you rewrite an application, you have to look at the existing
forces in an organization; chances are the previous team wasn&rsquo;t
terrible either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tons of factors influence the outcome of a project; it&rsquo;s not just about
teams and their skillset. Some forces in an organization can make it
close to impossible to ship good software; fear of change, lack of
vision, bone-dry information streams&hellip; So don&rsquo;t assume your rewrite
will fix everything.</p>
<h3 id="surprise">Surprise</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding surprise value is often not that valuable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to be related to the mantra of &lsquo;good enough&rsquo;. Sometimes we -
with the best intentions - invest more time and money in solving a
problem in the best possible way, than it will ever return.</p>
<p><em>These were some notes I wrote down the first two days. I&rsquo;ll try to go
through the other half over these next few days. I hope you found some
of them valuable too.</em></p>
