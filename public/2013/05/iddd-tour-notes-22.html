				<p>This is the second and last part of my notes I scribbled down attending
the IDDD Tour. <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/05/iddd-tour-notes-12.html">The first

published last week.</p>
<h3 id="a-better-model">A better model</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if you come up with a better model, the fact that it has been the
ubiquitous language of the domain for decades proves that it works for
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote bothers me a bit. There definitely is truth to this, but
modeling an existing process often presents such a great opportunity to
revise and improve it. Naked models don&rsquo;t conceal deficiencies,
inefficiencies and aberrations. Exploring alternative models free of
habituation, politics and legacy is dirt cheap, while the outcome could
considerably benefit all. It seems such a shame not to take advantage of
this. As with most things, know when to pick your fights.</p>
<h3 id="elegance">Elegance</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Elegance is for dressing, not for delivering software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one to remember; I&rsquo;ll be using this one next time someone uses
elegance as an argument for gold plating.</p>
<h3 id="cultivating-models">Cultivating models</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Models grow; you will never have the best model from the start.
Improve them every time you pass by.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your first attempt at it is hardly ever right. Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up
over it. The best models are the result of multiple iterations. In general I consider dwelling on one problem too long to be a waste of time. Settle for good enough, and allow the better solution to emerge by itself over time. When I feel a design is mighty important, I might accelerate this process by iterating over it multiple times in just a few days; asking for constant feedback, carrying the problem with me everywhere I go, always challenging it, and molding it in different shapes until one sticks.</p>
<h3 id="reuse">Reuse</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of people use a shared kernel just for reuse. It&rsquo;s often not
worth it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People are so obsessed with the DRY principle, and the dogma of avoiding
duplication, it often does more harm than good. Nonexistent concepts are
introduced just to spare a few duplicate lines of code, while they will
hinder and complicate autonomous evolution.</p>
<h3 id="rest-and-ddd">REST and DDD</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expose your domain model over REST: expose use cases. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You want to enable relentlessly evolving your domain model without
breaking clients. In practice you would post intent-revealing command
resources, while hypermedia guides you in navigating to subsequent
commands.</p>
<h3 id="published-language">Published language</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the language agreed upon; over lunch or by a committee?</p>
</blockquote>
<p> A great question which reveals if a language should be really
considered as published.</p>
<p><em>And that&rsquo;s the last of it. If you thought some of these were

dust for two months.</em></p>
