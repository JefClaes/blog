				<p>In my recent talk on <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2015/11/slides-from-my-talk-evil-by-design-at.html">Evil by
Design</a>,
I showed how I&rsquo;ve been visualizing event streams as a means to get a
better grip on how aggregates behave in production. The talk&rsquo;s scope
kept me from showing the code that goes together with the examples
shown. Consider this post as an addendum to that talk.</p>
<p>First off, we need a few types: a string that identifies a stream, an
event containing a timestamp and its name. A stream which is a
composition of an identifier and a sequence of events. We also need a
function that&rsquo;s able to read a stream based on its identifier.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve implemented that, we want to go ahead and visualize a single
stream. Having some experience with Google Charts, I used the
<a href="https://tahahachana.github.io/XPlot/">XPlot.GoogleCharts</a> package.</p>
<p>I want to visualize my event stream as a timeline. For that, it makes
only sense to use the Timeline graph. This means that I&rsquo;ll have to make
sure I transform my data into a format the Timeline chart can work with,
which is a sequence of tuples.</p>
<p>So we write a function which accepts a stream, and returns a sequence of
tuples containing the stream identifier, the event name and the
timestamp of the event.</p>
<p>With just a few lines of code, we can already compose our way to a
timeline.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2015-12-20-visualizing-event-streams-eventstream_viz_1.PNG"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2015-12-20-visualizing-event-streams-eventstream_viz_1.PNG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The result tells a small story: a withdrawal to a casino was requested
at 9:44PM, approved at 12:15PM the next day, and eventually completed 7
hours later.</p>
<p>From an operational perspective, this visualization can be used as
visual assistance for your support team when users have a question or a
complaint. From a more technical perspective, it can be used to get a
feel of the domain language and business processes without having to
look at code or tests. I could even see this being used in the
front-end, where you enable users to monitor a process; think package
tracking, document verification and so on.</p>
<p>Once you start exploring aggregates, you will notice that some
aggregates look healthier than others; lean and short-lived. While other
aggregates are fat and long-lived which can introduce a set of
problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>rebuilding state from a large event stream might kill performance</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s often more contention on larger aggregates making optimistic
(or pessimistic) concurrency very annoying</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/post/images/2015-12-20-visualizing-event-streams-eventstream_vis_1_1.PNG"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2015-12-20-visualizing-event-streams-eventstream_vis_1_1.PNG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Spotting one of these instances is an invitation to review your model,
to revise true invariants and to break things apart.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now looked at an aggregate&rsquo;s event stream in isolation, but often
something happening in one place leads to a reaction somewhere else. A
simple example: when a new user registers, a promotion is awarded. We
can visualize this by rendering multiple streams on one timeline.</p>
<p>Technically, we need to transform a sequence of streams to a single
sequence of tuples which we can feed the chart. It&rsquo;s as simple as
mapping each stream for then to flatten the result into a single
sequence.</p>
<p>This one extra step makes the result even more useful.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2015-12-20-visualizing-event-streams-eventstream_viz_2.PNG"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2015-12-20-visualizing-event-streams-eventstream_viz_2.PNG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more potential though; consider showing the payload when
hovering over an event, adding commands in the mix, zooming out, zooming
in, filtering&hellip;</p>
<p>If this is something you could see being useful to you or your
organization, let me know! Maybe I can port some bits and polish the
concept in the open.</p>
