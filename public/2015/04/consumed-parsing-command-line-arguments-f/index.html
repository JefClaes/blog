				<p>Last year, I set out to write my first node.js application; a small web
application for keeping lists of <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2015/01/consumed-in-2014.html">everything I
consume</a>. I had
something working pretty quickly, deployed it to Heroku and still find
myself using it today. Since there&rsquo;s very little use for having it
running on a server, and because I wanted something to toy with getting
better at F#, I decided to port it to an F# console application.</p>
<p>With the UI gone, I need to resort to passing in arguments from the
command line to have my program transform those into valid commands and
queries that can be executed.</p>
<p>The set of commands and queries is limited; consume an item, remove an
item and query a list of everything consumed.</p>
<p>Ideally I go from a sequence of strings to a typed command or query.
However, when the list of arguments can&rsquo;t be parsed, I expect a result
telling me what failed just the same.</p>
<p>Since we need the name to identify the command or query, I expect the
input to have at least two arguments.</p>
<p>Arguments come in pairs; a key and a value. My first thought was to
build a map here, but that made key validation, key transformations and
pattern matching harder.  I can actually get away with transforming the
input to a sequence of tuples.</p>
<p>Hoping to avoid some mistakes in the input, basic validation makes sure
the keys actually look like keys, instead of a value. Keys start with a
single or double dash.</p>
<p>Once that validation is out of the way, I strip away those dashes. That
should make the two last steps easier.</p>
<p>The name is required, so I wrote a small function that makes sure a
specific key exists.</p>
<p>Now that I have a list of arguments,  I can map them into a typed
command or query using pattern matching.</p>
<p>Having written all these small functions, I can simply compose them
using <a href="https://twitter.com/scottwlaschin">Scott Wlaschin</a>&lsquo;s <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2/">Railway
oriented
programmming</a>.</p>
<p>This is far from a generic command line parser, but it&rsquo;s simple and
covers my needs.</p>
<p>Next up, executing those commands and queries, and printing feedback.</p>
