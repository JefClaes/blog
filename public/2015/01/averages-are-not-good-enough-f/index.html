				<p>Let&rsquo;s (no pun intended) look at a set of response times of a web
service.</p>
<p>People like having a single number to summarize a piece of data. The
average is the most popular candidate. The average is calculated by
dividing the sum of the input elements by the number of input elements.</p>
<p>The average is a measure of centre which is fragile to outliers; one or
two odd irregular values might skew the outcome. The median on the other
hand is always representative of the centre, not just when the data
distribution is symmetric. The median is determined by sorting the input
elements and picking the one in the middle.</p>
<p>Both measures are terrible at showing how the data is distributed
though. The average and median response time might look fair, but maybe
there are a few outliers which are giving a few customers a bad time.</p>
<p>Instead of reducing our input down to a single number, it might be
better to extract a table that displays the frequency of various
outcomes in the input.</p>
<p>Now this is more useful; we can clearly see that the data is not
distributed equally and there are a few outliers in our response times
we need to investigate further.</p>
<p>This table takes up quite a bit of ink though. What if we want to get
rid of the table, but maintain a feel for the distribution of the
data?</p>
<p>The standard deviation measures the amount of variation from the
average. A low standard deviation means that the data points are very
close to the mean. A high standard deviation indicates that the data
points are spread out over a large range of values.<br>
It is calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squared
differences of the values from their average value.</p>
<p>The standard deviation is even more useful when you put the average at
the centre of a graph, lay out the input elements according their
deviation of the average and see a bell graph drawn. This means that we
can use the <em>empirical</em> 68-95-99.7 rule to get a feel of how the data is
distributed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In statistics, the so-called 68–95–99.7 rule is a shorthand used to
remember the percentage of values that lie within in a band around the
mean in a normal distribution with a width of one, two and three
standard deviations, respectively; more accurately, 68.27%, 95.45% and
99.73% of the values lie within one, two and three standard deviations
of the mean, respectively. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For our set of response times, this means that 68.27% of the response
times lies within the 24.8 and 66.4 range, 95.45% lies within the 4 and
87.2 range, while 99.73% lies within the -16.8 and 108 range.<br>

When we calculate the standard deviation, we can put one extra number
next to the average and derive from just two numbers how the data is
distributed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the mean and the median hide outliers. Looking at the
frequency distribution gives you a more complete picture. If we insist
on having less data to look at, the standard deviation and the
68–95–99.7 rule can compress the same complete picture into just two
numbers.</p>
