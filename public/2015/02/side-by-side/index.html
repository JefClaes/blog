				<p>This week marked my first year at my current employer. While that event
went by rather silently, one year in, a few of my observations are
finally shaping up to be cast into writing.</p>
<p>Where I used to work in the typical battery cage, I&rsquo;m now part of a team
of just four people, having the luxury of a big dedicated room to
ourselves - a whole floor actually. The room is set up almost
symmetrically; two desks on one side of the room and two more on the
other side, with quite some space in between. Having only four people in
the room makes it easy to casually throw something at the group - be it
a question, a critique or a random idea.</p>
<p>I made good use of this perk early on, but noticed that I would too
often find myself amid a Mexican Standoff. We would often get ourselves
into discussions that quickly turned into a
my-opinion-versus-your-opinion and would lead nowhere.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t make sense how I got myself into this situation time after
time, until I read somewhere how to approach petting an unfamiliar
dog.<br>
Our species have more in common than you would think. Our shared history
of pack hunting has made both our species highly social and
interdependent.<br>
For example, when you approach an unfamiliar dog, you shouldn&rsquo;t pet him
on the head since this can be very threatening. It&rsquo;s better to approach
him from the side to rub his ears, neck or back. This behaviour is an
evolutionary remnant of pack hunting; members of the pack would rub each
other&rsquo;s shoulder constantly chasing their next meal.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that the cause of our unproductive discussions might
be as simple as our desks being in an aggressive position, desk-to-desk
or face-to-face.<br>
Looking back at my previous jobs, I found no precedents of having
discussions in this position. The horrors of the open plan had always
forced me to either walk over or to find a meeting room.</p>
<p>But when I look at my personal relationships and discussions, I find
more situations that confirm this theory. When going for drinks, most of
my friends prefer a noisy and crowded bar, which force you side-by-side
just to make yourself understood. Even when communicating with my
girlfriend, it&rsquo;s not the clich√© tete-a-tete dinner dates that yield the
best conversations, it&rsquo;s taking a walk, long road trips or even cooking
together.</p>
<p>When it came to avoiding these unproductive situations at work, I now
carefully consider which things I can just throw out there, or which
things require a side-by-side approach. Even when you got yourself in
trouble face-to-face, you can still guide things into a more
constructive direction by changing the situation.</p>
<p>Getting side-by-side shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard in a professional
environment. Both pair programming and whiteboard sessions (or one of
its more exotic evolutions - model storming, mob programming etc) are
ingrained in most places now.</p>
<p>Evolution has wired our brain in a way that makes being side-by-side,
preferably chasing the same goal, extremely amicable. Although we&rsquo;re no
longer hunting for food, we still find ourselves chasing different means
of prosperity and success. Just like before, it&rsquo;s still the case that
we&rsquo;re at our best as a team, side-by-side, in pack.</p>
