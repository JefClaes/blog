				<p>As <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2015/04/parsing-command-line-arguments-with-f.html">I wrote
earlier</a>,
I&rsquo;ve been working on porting a node.js web application to an F# console
application. It&rsquo;s an application I wrote to learn node.js but still use
today to keep track of <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2015/01/consumed-in-2014.html">all the things I
consume</a>.</p>
<p>The application is able to consume an item, to remove a consumed item
and to query all consumed items.</p>
<p>In the previous post, I parsed command line arguments into typed
commands and queries. Today, I&rsquo;ll look at handling the two commands.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve refactored the command discriminated union to contain records with
data that go along with the command - I found that this makes for more
discoverable and refactor-friendly deconstruction later on.</p>
<p><strong>Validation</strong><br>
**<br>
**Before we do anything with the command, we need to make sure it passes
basic validation. The validate function takes a command, and returns a
success or failure result. Validation can fail because an argument is
empty, its structure is invalid or it&rsquo;s out of range. Inside the
function we match the command discriminated union with each case,
validate the data and return a result.</p>
<p><strong>Producing events</strong><br>
**<br>
**Having validated the command, we can start thinking about doing
something useful. I want the command handlers to be pure, to be able to
focus on computation, without having to worry about side effects.</p>
<p>Since the node.js web application stores its data in the form of events,
this one will too. I can now migrate the existing event store to a
simple text file living in my Dropbox, for then to drop the existing
Postgres database.</p>
<p>This means that command handlers will need to produce events.</p>
<p><strong>Dependencies</strong><br>
**<br>
**Looking at the tests the command handlers need to satisfy, we know
that a command handler depends on the system time and the eventstore.</p>
<p>The dependency on time is just a function that takes no arguments and
returns a datetime.</p>
<p>An implementation could look like this.</p>
<p>Reading an event stream is a function that takes a stream name and
returns an event stream.</p>
<p>Implementing a na√Øve event store takes more than one line on code.</p>
<p><strong>An eventstore</strong><br>
**<br>
**This implementation stores events in a text file. When an event is
stored, it gets serialized to JSON for then to be appended to a text
file. When reading a stream it will read all events from disk,
deserialize them to then filter by stream name before returning it as an
event stream - it&rsquo;s not exactly web scale.</p>
<p>The signature for reading a stream doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the signature we
defined earlier though. We can satisfy it by creating a <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/partial-application/">partially
applied
function</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Handlers</strong><br>
**<br>
**Handlers focus on pure computation, they just need to return an event
or a failure.</p>
<p>We can only consume an item once, and we can only remove items that
exist. It shouldn&rsquo;t be possible to consume items that have been removed.
There isn&rsquo;t much needed on the inside to cover these use cases.</p>
<p>We inject the event store and time dependencies by passing in the
relevant functions - since I&rsquo;m already using this function further on in
program.fs, the compiler can infer the signatures, no need to explicitly
state the signatures I defined earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Side effects</strong><br>
**<br>
**So far we have been able to avoid intentional side effects - we did
introduce functions that might have accidental side effects (reading
from disk and reading the system time ). It would be nice to be able to
restart the application without losing all state, so we need to take the
result the command produced and persist it. A small function takes care
of matching each result to invoke the relevant side effect. So far, we
only want to store events. With this, we successfully isolated side
effects to one small function.</p>
<p><strong>Putting it all together</strong><br>
**<br>
**By now, we can validate commands, handle them and take care of their
side effects. We can now compose those pieces together using <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2/">Railway
Oriented
Programming</a> and
invoke the pipeline. The output gets matched, so we can print something
relevant for the user to see.</p>
<p>Next time, we&rsquo;ll look at implementing queries.</p>
