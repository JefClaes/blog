<blockquote>
<p>Last year I ventured into the domain of (online) gambling. Given that
the industry has been around since forever, I expected most problems
to be of the technical kind. As it turned out, the struggle with
technology was only part of a bigger problem; to move forward we
needed to fully grasp the industry and its consumers. Events started out as a way to dismantle a legacy system, but quickly
proved to be an effective tool to gain a deeper understanding of our
domain. Visualising event streams, we discovered patterns that helped
us identify what drives different types of users. Having a better understanding of what customers are looking for, we
dove into existing literature to learn which techniques and models
casinos use to cater for each type of user. We learned how to program
chance while staying true to the Random Number God. Even when variance
is brutal, casinos have enough data and tools to steer clear from the
pain barrier. All of this entails interesting problems and software, but isn&rsquo;t my
code damaging society? Or is gambling just another human trait?</p>
