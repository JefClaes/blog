2011 and take a peek at 2012. Unlike the years before, I&rsquo;m hardly

<h3 id="my-career">My career</h3>
<p>The year started out interesting, working on a brand new product for
fire departments at Ferranti Computer Systems. Although my role in this
project should have been fairly satisfying, I still felt like my
position back then failed to fill a certain void. That&rsquo;s why I decided
to take the leap into <a href="https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/08/high-hopes.html">the Great
Unknown</a>.</p>
<p>In September, I started working for <a href="http://www.euri.com/">Euricom</a> as a
consultant. So far, I haven&rsquo;t regretted making that decision at all, I
ended up in a group of intelligent, progressive and enjoyable people.</p>
<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>
<p>This year I managed to write 69 posts (70 including this one), which is
a bit more than the year before.</p>
<p>Plenty of posts have gotten <a href="https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/12/2011s-most-read-posts.html">decent
attention</a>
this year, making the traffic tripple compared to 2010. And no matter
how other bloggers claim you shouldn&rsquo;t care about your blog statistics,
this does mean a bunch to me.</p>
<p><a href="/post/images/2011-12-26-2011-annual-review-BlogTraffic.PNG"><img src="/post/images/thumbnails/2011-12-26-2011-annual-review-BlogTraffic.PNG" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The main topics I wrote about this year were mostly web related (HTML5,
JavaScript and ASP.NET MVC). I even wrote some opinionated posts this
year, which I found harder, but also more rewarding.</p>
<p>Last year, I set a goal to get better at MVC and to at least look at
WebMatrix. I spent a large part of the year building things in ASP.NET
MVC at the day job, so that goal was easily achieved. I built <a href="https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/real-developer-knows-when-to-pull-plug.html">one small
thing</a>
in
<a href="https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/05/my-thoughts-on-webmatrix.html">WebMatrix</a>,
which was enough to give me a feel of what WebMatrix is all about.</p>
<p>My guess is that I will cover similar topics next year. My faith in the
web has only grown stronger. I think the rise and rise of the browser
and JavaScript provides us with unseen opportunities, but also with an
enormous amount of challenges. I am really eager to start looking more
into <em>serious</em> JavaScript development.</p>
<h3 id="community">Community</h3>
<p>I think I did fairly well this year. I attended several local community
meetings and got to to know a lot of nice people in the process.</p>
<p>The highlight probably was <a href="https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/04/video-slides-and-source-from-my.html">my own talk on WebSockets at HTML5
Webcamps</a>.
I really enjoyed that experience. I do not aspire to be a speaker
though, but should I have interesting things to talk about, I probably
won&rsquo;t reject invitations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I will be doing a lot of community events in 2012. I
often don&rsquo;t seem to get out of them what I hoped for. Also, Euricom
regularly organizes meetups to talk about all things software
development. These will already consume plenty of time.</p>
<h3 id="travelling">Travelling</h3>
<p>This year my girlfriend and I did <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/once-upon-time-in-west.html">a three-week roadtrip along the West
Coast</a>.
This trip was by far the best time of our lives. We are determined to
undertake similar projects in the future again.</p>
<p>Next to that, we revisited the Czech Republic, taking plenty of time to
<a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/04/prague-impressions.html">visit
Prague</a> this
time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sure what 2012 will bring. Right now, we are looking into
something more nearby, Italy.</p>
<h3 id="sporthealth">Sport/Health</h3>
<p>Last year I picked up boxing, but I had to give that up due to
scheduling conflicts. I have been working a tweaked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P90X">P90X
routine</a> twice a week instead, which
is very much recommended.</p>
<p>I reasonably succeeded in achieving my running ambitions. Altogether, I
ran somewhere around 800 kilometers (= 500 miles) this year. This
summer, I probably was in the best shape of my life, running 15 km
pretty (= 9 miles) comfortably. Although the graph below suggests that
I&rsquo;m slacking, it&rsquo;s only partially true. I have been doing shorter (and
higher paced) runs lately, increasing the intensity. Running is probably
one of the sports that give me the most energy in return, so I intend to
stay at it.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>2011 has been an eventful year for me. In 2012, I hope to be able to
keep doing the things I love, surrounded by the people I love. Trying to
live life as much as I can.</p>
<p><em>I wish you and your family the best for 2012. That the new year may bring you health, love and plenty of hacking.</em></p>
