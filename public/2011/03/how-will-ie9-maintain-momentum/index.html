9</a>
this week.</p>
<p>I have been using IE9 since the first platform preview, and I think it&rsquo;s
a very solid browser, outclassing every previous Microsoft browser <em>by
far</em>. Microsoft finally built a browser which is capable of competing
with other modern browsers.</p>

The global consensus seems to be that Internet Explorer has regained
serious momentum. Now I wonder how Microsoft plans on maintaining that
momentum. IE9 still has some issues to address, and with the HTML5
specifications progressing at this rate, a ton of specs will be stable
in the near future.</p>
<p>I think a big part of the future success of IE9 is directly proportional
to the ability to leverage these fixes and new features.</p>

As far as I know they are going to continue pushing browser updates
through Windows Updates, and this raises a few concerns. A lot of people
have disabled automatic Windows Updates. Either they are using a pirated
OS, or they simply have disabled them. In corporate environments where
IT administrators decide which updates get pushed, often only the
essential - security - updates get pushed.</p>
<p>The way Google Chrome leverages updates is far better. Maybe you haven&rsquo;t
noticed, but Chrome updates itself on a daily basis. If you open the
Task Scheduler you will find GoogleUpdate tasks which run daily. I
believe this is one of the key reasons Google Chrome is so popular in
the developer community. This aggressive update progress enables Google
to implement features, and fix them real quick when something is
broken.</p>
<p>Do we really need to wait for IE10 to have support for more HTML5
features? Will the future bring an army of Frankenstein Internet
Explorers?<br>
Or will Microsoft revise their update strategy? Something I would like
to see them do is decouple the IE update process from Windows Updates,
especially for home users. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Make web not
