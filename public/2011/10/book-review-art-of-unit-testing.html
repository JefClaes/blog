targets a broad audience. Beginners will find every part of the book
useful, where intermediates might be more interested in the final two
parts.</p>
<p><a href="http://osherove.com/blog/">Roy Osherove</a> starts this book by laying a
solid foundation of the unit testing concept. Why is testing important?
What defines a good unit test, and how does a unit test differ from an
integration test? In the second part of the book, he demonstrates the
use of two core unit testing techniques: stubs and mocks. After showing
you how these techniques work, he shows off various isolation frameworks
which can help you creating stubs and mocks at runtime (fakes), greatly
reducing the effort of writing these objects.</p>
<p>If you have some experience with unit testing, you might not be
impressed with the content of the book so far. If you&rsquo;re somewhat like
me, and have been writing tests for some while, but often find yourself
wondering if your tests will still be considered solid six months from
now, you will find the content of part three very useful. In this part,
Roy talks about organizing your tests and how to strive for satisfying
the three pillars of good tests: trustworthiness, maintainability and
readability.</p>
<p>The final part wasn&rsquo;t something I expected to find in this book. In this
chapter it&rsquo;s very clear that the author has been an agent of change
himself for a long time. Next to sharing successful strategies on how to
usher testing into the organization, he answers a bunch of hard
questions you will be asked when you&rsquo;re on your own quest to bring
change.</p>
<p>As I said before, there&rsquo;s something in the book for everyone. While
there are a lot of topics discussed, the book counts less than 300
pages. It&rsquo;s well written at large, sometimes a bit sloppy, but in
general a smooth read. All of the concepts are explained using examples
written in C#, where the problems are small enough to keep it simple,
yet comprehensive enough to make it a plausible scenario.</p>
<p>If you want to start out with unit testing, are looking for confirmation
on how you&rsquo;re doing or want to refine some techniques, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988274/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diofanedebyje-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399377&amp;creativeASIN=1933988274">this
book</a>
might be the one to get.</p>
