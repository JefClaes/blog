				<p>Last week, I wrote something on <a href="http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2011/10/viewmodel-assemblers-in-aspnet-mvc.html">assembling viewmodels in ASP.NET
MVC</a>.
In that post, I said it would be nice to have a layer between my
controller and my domain services that would assemble viewmodels for me.
This would work one-way. In the other direction - from controller to
domain services - I would just take a piece of my composite viewmodel
and pass that directly to my domain services.</p>
<p>Well, that last part didn&rsquo;t really work out eventually. I found it hard
to find real-world scenarios where I could just pick a piece of my
viewmodel and directly pass it to the domain services.</p>
<p>I was in need of something that could extract my domain models from my
dumb viewmodels. I really didn&rsquo;t want this logic to be a fixed part of
my viewmodel, nor did I want to make helper classes for these utility
methods. Looking for a place to put this, I thought of a set of
extension methods that pulls out every useful domain model per
viewmodel.</p>
<pre><code>public static class AddEntryViewModelExtractors

{

    public static Entry ExtractEntry(this AddEntryViewModel addEntryViewModel) 

    {

        var entry = new Entry();

 

        entry.Activity = new Activity();

        entry.Activity.Name = addEntryViewModel.ActivityName;            

        entry.Meta = addEntryViewModel.Meta;

 

        return entry;

    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it possible to do something like this in my controller.</p>
<pre><code>public ActionResult Add(AddEntryViewModel addEntryViewModel)

{

    if (ModelState.IsValid)

    {

        _entryService.AddEntry(addEntryViewModel.ExtractEntry());

 

        return RedirectToAction(&quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;);

    }

    else

    {

        return View(addEntryViewModel);

    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>So far, I&rsquo;m liking this approach, pushing code away from the controller,
helping me to keep my controllers as lean as possible. I also enjoy that
it&rsquo;s trivial to test these extractor methods.</p>
<p>Oh btw, I had a chance to look at AutoMapper, but I haven&rsquo;t decided yet
whether I find it helpful or not. I hardly came across scenarios where
simple mappings were sufficient.</p>
<p>As always, I welcome your feedback and thoughts!</p>
