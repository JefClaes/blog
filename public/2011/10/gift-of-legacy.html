				<p>Just after graduating, I hated legacy with the heat of a thousand suns.
I felt unfortunate, having to work on old code, built using outdated
technologies, while software is all about making new and shiny things.
<em>Right, guys?</em> Those na誰ve expectations of a rookie got crumbled very
soon. Legacy is a constant in our industry. You can try to ignore it as
long as possible, but it&rsquo;s impossible to keep that up forever. Over the years, I have come to accept that. I even have been fully
embracing it lately.</p>
<p>Legacy is an opportunity to learn from the past. To learn from the
costly mistakes our predecessors made, so you can avoid them in the
present. Often legacy also helps me fully comprehend the motivation
behind more modern architectures and software practices. Finding
yourself all alone in thousands of lines of code, where the smallest
change can impact an unknown amount of long forgotten scenarios, makes
it perfectly clear why we test our code, and why it should be a crime
not to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that there often isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of glory in maintaining
old software. Although, I do think some programmers should be awarded a
medal of honor after serving multiple months in the trenches. There is,
however, a lot of space to make small refactorings, improving the code
quality and in the meanwhile giving you the small wins you need to keep
going.</p>
<p>All legacy isn&rsquo;t bad per se though. Once in a while you discover <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphUt_tp898#t=01m22s">a ruby
in the dust</a>; a
creative solution or a small but interesting trick, which you might be
able to apply later on.</p>
<p>Legacy is a gift, learn to embrace it.</p>
