<p>This book is mainly directed to (advertisement) designers, but since I
feel that designers and developers do have a few things in common, we
both like to create things, I also read it.</p>
<p>The content of this book is a collection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Arden">Paul Ardens</a> observations on business and life presented in a <em>very</em> consumable format. As it turns out, although I am not part of the target audience, a good amount of his thoughts can be applied to software development as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are involved in something that goes wrong, never blame others.
Blame no one but yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Give away everything you know, and more will come back to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look for the next opportunity. The one you have in hand is the
opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The person who doesn&rsquo;t make mistakes is unlikely to make anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you get stuck, draw with a different pen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to work with the best.</p>
