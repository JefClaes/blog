It got a little out of hand. After publishing, I showed it to a few
popular tweeps, and they were kind enough to mention it. 24 hours after
the launch it has gotten over 3.5k unique visitors, 39k page views (see
what I did there?) and over 240 submissions. Being mentioned by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/shanselman">Scott
Hanselman</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/reybango">Rey

<p>I kind of felt like a mini - Mark Zuckerberg constantly refreshing the
page and reading new quotes hours afer the launch.</p>
<p>I was somewhat surprised by how original and creative our community is.
Some of my favorite quotes so far..</p>
<p>A real developer has changed live code in production at least once,
begrudgingly. (by
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jasonfamularo">@jasonfamularo</a>)<br>
A real developer has code on his t-shirt. (by
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stevenmilne">@stevenmilne</a>)<br>
A real developer knows family is more important than computers. (by
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/shanselman">@shanselman</a>)<br>
A real developer tries to write as little code as possible. (by
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/marknijhof">@marknijhof</a>)<br>
A real developer works in the dark, but communicates with those in the
light. (by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/atcrawford">@atcrawford</a>)<br>
A real developer understands code is nearly the same as an organic
life-form that evolves. (by
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stefandidak">@stefandidak</a>)</p>
<p>And so much more of them are awesome.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>
<p>I enjoyed the experience so far. I&rsquo;m well aware that this buzz will end
soon, but I&rsquo;m going to try to maintain momentum as long as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I am eager to hear your suggestions and feedback.</p>
<p>Requests received so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it possible to up- or downvote quotes.</li>
<li>Make a smart algorithm based on those votes.</li>
<li>Make it easier to link to quotes.</li>
<li>Twitter authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>I might open source this little project (it&rsquo;s only 50 lines of code) and
I might do a few blog posts on the making of in the next weeks.</p>
