				<p>My mini-website <a href="#">arealdeveloper.com</a> will no
longer be available online after tomorrow.</p>
<p>I slapped it together over a weekend, trying out WebMatrix, which turned
out to be the <a href="https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/05/my-thoughts-on-webmatrix.html">perfect companion</a>
for <a href="https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/building-small-things.html">building small things</a>.</p>
<p>A pleasant surprise was <a href="https://jefclaes.be/2011/05/arealdevelopercom-mentioned-on-channel9.html">the mention of &lsquo;A Real Developer&rsquo; by the guys at Channel9</a>. This made the traffic go through the roof for a few days.</p>
<p>A few months later the site was a ghosttown. But I don&rsquo;t mind, had to happen. It never had the ambition to deliver real value. I was more than happy to deliver five minutes of entertainment.</p>

<p>To have a memento, I <a href="https://github.com/JefClaes/ARealDeveloper">uploaded the source to GitHub</a>. Remember, it&rsquo;s far from clever or impressive. However, I do think it can serve as a nice introduction-by-example to WebMatrix.</p>
<p>I committed the latest database as well, so now you can read all the
quotes (even the bad ones), and start your own t-shirt business ;).</p>
