<p>Although I think performance is important, relevant performance
improvements are, apart from in tight loops, hardly ever to find in
language constructs. To put it more bluntly, they are a waste of time.
When translating your thoughts into code, you should aim to make your
intentions as clear as possible for the person who comes after you.
Don&rsquo;t obfuscate your code for an negligible performance improvement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not advocating readability and pretty code are an end goal,
performance and quality still are. But look for optimizations where it
counts: optimizations which, after measuring, prove to be make a
significant impact on the overall performance of your system. These are
most likely to be found in I/O operations, architectures and algorithms.
Not in language constructs.</p>
