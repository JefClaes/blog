				<p>The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399536108?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diofanedebyje-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0399536108">The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life
You Want, and Change the
World</a>
was written by Chris Guillebeau.</p>
<p>I learned about this book through Chris&rsquo; blog. He hosts a <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/">very popular
blog</a> where he writes on lifehacking,
entrepreneurship and his goal to travel to each country in the world.</p>
<p>In this book Chris tries to show the reader that you don&rsquo;t have the live
your life the way other people expect you to. As long as you are open to
new ideas, are dissatisfied with the status quo and are willing to work
hard, you should be able to live the life of your dreams.</p>
<p>The first part of this book was an eye-opener for me. Once you find
something that you really enjoy doing, your passion, make a commitment
and be dedicated to use it to make a positive change. For yourself and
for the world. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to be somehow different, a lot of great
things have been accomplished outside the status quo. If living the life
you want, takes it for you to be unconventional and nonconformist,
overcome your fear, and pursue it.</p>
<p>In the second and last part of the book, Chris lost most of my interest.
In the second part he shares his personal experience with education,
building an army of followers and financing a noncomformist lifestyle.
The last part of this book is on building a legacy.</p>
<p>Throughout the book Chris shares his personal stories and aneckdotes.
There are also dozens of stories about other people changing their lifes
for the better. I especially enjoyed the latter. In his personal stories
some of his achievements are repeated throughout the book, which
sometimes gives the impression he wrote the book to brag and to promote
the AONC brand. Another letdown of this book is that some of the advice
isn&rsquo;t useful for most of us. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent-flyer_program">Frequent flyer
miles</a> anyone?</p>
<p>I enjoyed the first part of the book <strong>a lot</strong>. Too bad the other parts
mostly failed in keeping me interested.</p>
