<p>The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061721727?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diofanedebyje-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0061721727">Got

was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Griffin">Forrest
Griffin</a>, assisted by
Erich Krauss.</p>
<p>Forrest Griffin is one of the toughest light-heavyweight mixed martial
artists competing in the <a href="http://uk.ufc.com/">UFC</a>. If you are
unfamiliar with MMA and UFC, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsUW3x3GSWE">watch one of the
Forrest Griffin tribute
videos</a> on Youtube.</p>

This book touches several subjects. Forrest talks about the path he
followed to become a professional fighter and what made him who he is
today. Forrest also shares a bunch of advice on fighting and
non-fighting topics. The last part of the book contains a series of
how-to MMA techniques. All these topics are talked together in the form
of <strong>hilarious</strong>, and sometimes offending (to some of you), ramblings.
After all, the main goal to read this book shouldn&rsquo;t be to learn, but to
be entertained, and <em>maybe</em> learn something along the way!</p>
<p>Below you can find some quotes taken from the book, which will probably
tell you a lot more than my small summary above.</p>
<h3 id="forrest-on">Forrest on..</h3>
<p>.. sphincter control</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in the day, when I first met a chick, there was no way I would
let one rip. I would wait until at least the second or third date
before I introduced her to my Love Potion 109.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. advice for the fat and tremendously out-of-shape fighter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steroids, steroids, steroids. This magic elixir can replace all forms
of training and will add to your intimidating appearance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. cheating</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When asked about the tactic after the fight, Tito said, &lsquo;If you ain&rsquo;t
cheating, you ain&rsquo;t trying&rsquo;. I would have to agree with him. I would
rather be known as a cheater than a loser. Seriously, I have this deep
hatred of losing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. fear</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A black eye will dissapear and a broken nose can be mended. Fear is a
good thing because it keeps you alive, but it becomes so great that it
hinders you from doing what you want, you need to confront it head-on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. eating challenges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I kept mumbling over and over, &lsquo;Oh God, I made a mistake&rsquo;, and
vociferously promised sweet baby Jesus I would never accept an eating
challenge again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. being humble</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although it can be depressing to admit to yourself that you will never
be the best, it is liberating at the same time. Instead of trying to
be better than everyone else, which is existentially arrogant, you can
focus on being the best that you can be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>My rating: 4/5</strong>. This is probably the funniest book I have ever
read.</p>
