This time of year, we're all very busy honoring
traditions. This post is no exception
([2009](http://www.jefclaes.be/2009/12/high-5-five-most-popular-blog-posts-of.html),
[2010](http://www.jefclaes.be/2010/12/top-5-popular-posts-of-2010.html),
[2011](http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/12/2011s-most-read-posts.html),
[2012](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/12/2012s-most-read-posts.html)).</span>

Today was probably the first time this year that I
took some time to study my blog's Google Analytics metrics. If I keep
last year's [black swan posts](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/03/how-web-application-can-download-and.html)
out of the equation, traffic seems to be comparable to last year's. The
most meaningful metrics to me are the number of subscriptions and the
average time spent reading. Both of them increased - happy about
that!

The actor model has been gaining in popularity more
and more. Next to addressing more infrastructural concerns, it can also
be used as a framework for modeling and reasoning about complex systems.
Working with a team of mainframe programmers over the last year, I
observed a few similarities in how they have been designing their
systems. [Actor Model in
COBOL](http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/09/actor-model-in-cobol.html) is the
third most read post of 2013.

The second most read post was [Not handling edge
cases, making them explicit
instead](http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/06/not-handling-edge-cases-making-them.html).
Inspired by a talk with Greg Young at DDDX, I tried to create a
narrative that uncovered an edge case in a green field project. Instead
of handling the edge case, we use an event to make it explicit, allowing
a human to intervene. This way we can go to market more quickly, with
less code, and we might even end up with happier customers.</span>

Number one is [But I already wrote
it](http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/08/but-i-already-wrote-it.html). In this
post I shared my motivation having an argument with a colleague about
whether to dump some code that did too much. Don't cherish your code.
It's nothing but a means to an end; the side product of creating a
solution. Aim for simple and lean solutions; nobody likes bulky
software, nobody likes fighting complexity all day. Don't neglect the
hidden cost of that extra small feature you're throwing in.</span>

**Thank you** for reading!
