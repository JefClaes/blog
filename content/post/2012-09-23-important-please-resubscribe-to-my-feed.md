Maybe the writing has been on the wall for Feedburner for a long time.
No features were added for over four years, no bugs were fixed, the
look-and-feel wasn't updated to be consistent with other Google
products, support channels were being shut down,... But it wasn't until
last Friday that the degradation of the service really got tangible: all
subscriber counts indicated zero. Dozens of people complained, using all
possible communication channels, but nobody listened.  
  
When I set up this blog almost five years ago, I made the mistake of
pointing people to a naked Feedburner url, which now forces me to ask my
subscribers to resubscribe. I've learned my lesson, and I've set up a
more sustainable url: <http://feed.jefclaes.be/jefclaes>.  
  
I always valued RSS subscribers more than people coming from search
engines; it encourages me to know there are people curious for more
content. So if you're reading this, please unsubscribe from this feed,
and resubscribe to <http://feed.jefclaes.be/jefclaes>, the current feed
will phase out over the next thirty days.  
  
**TL;DR: Feedburner is dead. I messed up by pointing you there. Please
resubscribe to <http://feed.jefclaes.be/jefclaes>.**
