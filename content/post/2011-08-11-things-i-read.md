Over the years I have collected an impressive collection of technology
related feeds in my [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader/) account.
Lately, I find myself neglecting most of my Google Reader subscriptions,
and getting my information from a few specific sources. It just has
become too much of a chore to sift out the really interesting posts.  
  
That's why I have put my faith in the community to do the dirty work.

For .NET related posts, I mainly keep track of these two linkblogs.

-   [The Morning Brew](http://blog.cwa.me.uk/)
-   [Dew Drop](http://www.alvinashcraft.com/)

For other programming content that isn't biased towards the Microsoft
stack, I also read following community driven link aggregators.

-   [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) (!)
-   [The Programming Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming)

How do <span style="font-weight:bold;">you</span> try to cope with the
abundance of information out there?
