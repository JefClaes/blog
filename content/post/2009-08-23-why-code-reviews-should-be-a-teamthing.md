Often code reviews are done by one person, the technical lead of your
team.  
  
In my opinion it's better to make each developer of your team do code
reviews.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">My arguments</span>  

1.  Having all developers doing code reviews enforces well-documented
    coding standards..
2.  Which also leads to discussions about what these coding standards
    should be.
3.  Each developer is forced to understand the workflow of an
    application which isn't his, which expands his domain knowledge.
4.  Each developer learns from others and is given an opportunity to
    teach and discuss why someone chose a certain path.. There is always
    something new to learn, even for seasoned developers. You might just
    pick up that latest trick doing whizbang Silverlight 3 stuff from
    that freshman that just started working this year.
5.  Multiple perspectives on a problem can only benefit the solution.
