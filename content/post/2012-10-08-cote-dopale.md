The girlfriend, me and another couple, returned from a short weekend at
the [French Opal Coast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_d'Opale)
yesterday evening. Although we only planned this trip a  week in
advance, we still failed to anticipate how erratic the weather can be in
October; setting up camp in the dark, on a sloughy underground, with a
soft drizzle on your back, isn't my idea of fun after a long day at
work. The next morning, with destination [Cape Blanc
Nez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_Blanc_Nez), we drove over coastal
routes between vast green fields, towards clearer skies. Passing white
cliffs of clay and untouched beaches, we eventually halted at the
obelisk commemorating the [Dover
Patrol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover_Patrol) for a while. Here you
can clearly see the English coast on the other side of the canal; no
wonder this spot was strategically ideal to safeguard the canal during
World War I. Differing from the main route, we discovered the ramshackle
remainder of a bunker. I think it's fascinating how quickly something
what once played an important role in our history, can lose its
prestige, and be seen for what it is: a massive block of concrete.  
  
I honestly was taken aback by the beauty of the Northern French coast. I
had always unjustifiably ignored this area, and now I will definitely
have to revisit.  
  
Sunday, before leaving, we visited a local
[bric-à-brac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bric-%C3%A0-brac). Just
before returning to the car, my girlfriend spotted an antique camera
satchel, which she thought would make a unique accessory - you know how
girls are, right? The woman behind the stand wouldn't let it go without
the camera though, and asked too much for both, so we strolled on.
Passing the same spot a few minutes later, she inquired how much we
wanted to give her for it. Mistakenly, my girlfriend said *dix-cinq*
(ten five) instead of using the more correct *quinze* (fifteen). The
woman understood this as *dis cinq* (how about five), and doubled it to
ten. Sold! And that's how my girlfriend saved herself five euros without
even having to haggle.

Thanks to our companion Lars Oliviers for letting me put his pictures in
this post.
