On our way back from DDD Exchange, heavily influenced by yet another
immersive DDD experience, we searched for ways to keep the momentum
going. Sure, we met up regularly for CQRS beers, but we felt that we
could do more, better. That's when we coined the term modellathon,
something like a hackathon, but instead of writing code, we would build
models.  
  
Thanks to the effort of [Mathias](https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes),
[Stijn](https://twitter.com/stijnvnh) and
[Yves](https://twitter.com/yreynhout), Tuesday marked the first
get-together of [the Belgian DDD user group](http://domaindriven.be/) in
its official form. Combell was kind enough to provide us with a
location, while Mathias fronted paper - lots of it too, post-its and
markers.  
  
Mathias and Stijn took the lead introducing themselves as domain experts
of the day. The domain? The United Schools of Kazachstan.  
  
We split up into groups of four, and used our first pomodoro trying to
understand the domain. The second pomodoro, we threw everything away and
started fresh.  
  
The first modeling technique our group tried was [Alberto
Brandolini](https://twitter.com/ziobrando)'s event storming. We took
what we thought was the most important event *report approved*, wrote it
on a post-it, and posted it on the center of our sheet of paper. Then we
worked our way back to how we got there, but also looked at what
happened next. This modeling approach yielded results very quickly; we
all gained a decent understanding of everything what's going on in the
domain. Talking to the domain expert made it obvious what the hotspots
were, he kept referring to two post-its in particular.  
  
We might have zoomed in right there, but for the sake of experimenting
with event storming, we stuck to events a little longer. We added
commands, looked for clusters, made aggregate boundaries based on that,
and looked where they were talking to each other.  
  
We initially used a sheet of paper and stayed seated, but this was
holding us back. Once we stood up and moved to the wall, our synergy
increased. Space and blood circulation seem to be important.  
  
Flow is important too. Since we only had two domain experts, we often
had to make assumptions and come up with a name that made sense. This
slowed us down. We should just write down whatever we come up with, and
make doubts explicit on the post-it. You can always verify and fix the
language consulting the domain experts later.  
  
The next visualization technique, initiated by Yves, took a UI-first
approach. While this quickly gives you something concrete to chat about
with the domain expert, I learned it can also lead you to bounded
context boundaries by helping you answer the question "Where is all this
data coming from, whichÂ *contexts* does this data belong to?"  
  
*I thought this first experiment went really well - a lot better than I
expected. It proves once again the value of visualization and
collaboration. All models were probably wrong, but turned out to be
useful. The end result probably doesn't matter that much, discovery and
learning along the way does.*

Note to self: make pictures of the end results; they would help
explaining some of the experiments.
