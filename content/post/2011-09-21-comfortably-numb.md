Something that can bother me tremendously is being surrounded by people
who are in a constant state of being [comfortably numb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wtiNzci1Wc). People who don't
welcome change, try to scare away new concepts and are just too much at
home in their comfort zone. Some are perfectly happy filling their days
keeping up appearances of being busy. They don't care about
self-improvement, but only care about augmenting their paychecks by
accumulating as much legacy baggage as possible, with the sole intention
of being perceived as an irreplaceable asset to the company, whilst not
having to leave their comfort zone. These people also have the tendency
to shy away from responsibility and commitment. They are satisfied with
doing just enough to not draw any attention to themselves.  
  
It's really tempting to just go along, and follow. After all, it's in
human nature to strive for comfort: the path of the least resistance. If
you are reading this blog, you probably already belong to the group of
people who care about their craft, and are aiming for something more
than the status quo. I applaud you. For you, this post only serves as a
reminder that you should constantly evaluate your current position and
be honest with yourself: Am I still moving forward?
