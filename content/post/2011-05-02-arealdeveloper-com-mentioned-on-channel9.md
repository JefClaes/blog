While nosing around in the
[arealdeveloper.com](http://arealdeveloper.com/) analytics, I saw a
bunch of traffic coming from [Channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/).
Clicking through, I found out [A Real
Developer](http://arealdeveloper.com/) was mentioned in [this
video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/TWC9-HouseBuilder-Solver-Dev-Labs-Project-Windows-Shell-Extensions)
(02:01). That's a Channel9 front-page video!  
  

  
  
That's so awesome, I think it's great people find it a fun project.  
  
I have been listening to [your
feedback](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2011/04/arealdevelopercom.html#comments),
and this Sunday I implemented some of your requests:

-   Easier linking
-   Sharing
-   A feed
-   Voting
-   Comments

  
I try to keep everything as simple as possible, that's why I implemented
most of these features using two popular free plug-ins:
[AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/) and [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).  
  
For those interested, I will do a few posts on the making of
arealdeveloper.com this month.  
  
Oh, and by the way, for Americans, they did pretty well pronouncing my
last name ;)
