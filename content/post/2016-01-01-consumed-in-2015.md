I started in
[2014](http://www.jefclaes.be/2015/01/consumed-in-2014.html) to keep
lists of everything I consume. I've continued this effort throughout
2015 and can now share the items I particularly enjoyed.  
  
In 2015, I read 16 books and 3 papers, watched 3 movies and 4 shows,
listened to 1 audio book and no podcasts. A lot less TV compared to
2014, but most of that time went to playing video games with some of my
friends. Also a lot less time spent in the car listening to audiobooks
or podcasts, since I'm now dropping off my girlfriend every day.
