According to [Matt from
37signals](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2500-lets-be-honest-sent-from-my)
the line "Sent from my iPhone" at the bottom of an email means this:  

> Let’s be honest. “Sent from my iPhone” really means “I’m not going to
> bother to proofread and correct this because it would take me an extra
> 30 seconds.”

I agree. I too use this line as an excuse to write a terse message and
omit proper salutations.  
  
However, I also think these four simple words greatly helped the viral
growth of the mobile phone. Having early adopters brag about how they're
sending emails from their fancy new phone must have been an invaluable
form of word-of-mouth advertising.  
  
I think it's safe to say that those four words first are a marketing
technique and then a convenient way of letting your correspondents know
that there might be a typo in your message. If not, the default line
wouldn't include the brand name.  
  
I'm turning this thing into a rambling though. What I really wanted to
share is a snippet of the *much recommended* book [The Lean
Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307887898%22),
where [Eric Ries](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/) shares a story
on how Hotmail used a similar technique in 1996 to fuel their viral
engine of growth.  

> But everything changed when they made one small tweak to the product.
> They added to the bottom of every e-mail the message "P.S. Get your
> free e-mail at Hotmail" along with a clickable link.  
> Within weeks, that small product change produced massive results.
> Within six months, Bhatia and Smith had signed up more than 1 million
> new customers. Five weeks later, they hit the 2 million mark. Eighteen
> months after launching the service, with 12 million subscribers, they
> sold the company to Microsoft for $400 million.

I find it incredibly intriguing how a few words can have such an impact.
Maybe you do too.
