After building
[arealdeveloper.com](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2011/04/arealdevelopercom.html),
I felt like I had to do a follow-up post sharing my experiences with
[WebMatrix](http://www.asp.net/webmatrix). While doing some research, I
came across [this
post](http://blog.wekeroad.com/microsoft/someone-hit-their-head) by Rob
Connery. And frankly, I think it's almost impossible for me to add
something to his findings.  
  
**In a nutshell**  
  
For those who are like "tl;dr", here are my thoughts on WebMatrix..  
  
WebMatrix is the perfect framework to start with ASP.NET development
(wish I had). For people who are already familiar with ASP.NET,
WebMatrix will hardly have any learning curve. They should also have a
look at it though, because it's a lot of **fun** Ã¡nd it is a great
framework to **get things done**. Every developer has been asked - at
least once - to slap together a site for a distant acquaintance, where
the site consists of mostly static pages, with a dynamic
List&lt;Something&gt; pulled out of a database. I see WebMatrix as a
perfect **gluing framework** to swiftly ship these types of projects.
While you **could** probably also build something more enterprisey, I
don't think you should.  
  
**See for yourself**  
  
I have [uploaded the source of
arealdeveloper.com](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19698383/Blog/ARealProgrammer.zip).
Download WebMatrix using the [WebPlatform
Installer](http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx) and see
for yourself.  
  
You might notice that the project is called arealprogrammer. That was
the name of the project before I bought the wrong domain name.
