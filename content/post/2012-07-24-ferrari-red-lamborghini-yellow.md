<span style="background-color: white;">After 14 hours and 34 minutes in
the car, driving 1148km, over the German autobahn, swerving Austrian
roads, and the Italian autostrade, defying overwhelming hail storms,
roadwork and miles long tunnel congestions, we arrived at Torbole,
Italy.</span>

  

[Torbole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nago-Torbole) is a small village,
nestled between the mountains, right at the edge of [Lake
Garda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Garda). While the lakeside view
is astonishing, you have to pick the right time to truly experience it.
In the daytime, the village is overwhelmed by tourists; miles long rows
of cars queue to enter the village, pizzerias and ristorantes on every
corner, Germans galore. This doesn't take away that this location is a
great launching point to visit other places in northern Italy though.

After a lazy day yesterday, we drove two hours South today, to
Sant'Agata Bolognese and Maranello, to visit two legendary car
manufacturers:
[Lamborghini](http://www.lamborghini.com/en/heritage/museum/overview/)
and [Ferrari](http://museo.ferrari.com/). While both museums only take
around 40 minutes to visit, I definitely was more impressed by the
Lamborghini museum. Compared to the Ferrari museum, the Lamborghini
museum seemed to exhibit far more (non-racing) eccentric and rare
models.

Since both museums failed to entertain us for longer than an hour, we
visited [Verona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona) on our way back.
While we didn't enter any tourist attractions, we enjoyed strolling
through the old town, blending into the mass, only halting on a Roman
square to pay way too much for an iced cappuccino which was served
lukewarm.
