I wrote an article titled '[The open plan
fallacy](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/05/open-plan-fallacy.html)' just
two weeks ago. Earlier this week [a similar
article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/science/when-buzz-at-your-cubicle-is-too-loud-for-work.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all)
was published by the New York Times. The content of that article wasn't
particularly extraordinary, but the comments were. I waded through all
of them on my daily commute, and it's really hard to find one in favor
of open plan offices - people seem to be enraged.  
  
I handpicked some of the most interesting ones.

In my article, I advocated isolating teams instead of individuals, but
most commenters seem to be heavy supporters of private offices -
including walls and a door. I never experienced that in a professional
environment, so I couldn't say if that would work for software
development. Can you? Collaboration and communication between developers
is a necessity. Fostering that just seems hard when everyone is in a
separate place - definitely for young teams. While comparing office
layouts, I wondered how my proposed solution would scale; how many
people can you put in one team before you encounter the same undesired
open plan side-effects?
