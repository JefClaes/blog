In this post you can find information on the sessions I attended at
[TechEd Europe](http://europe.msteched.com/) today. I tried to give a
very brief summary per session accompanied with some interesting links
you can use to find more information on the subject.  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Getting your return on investment with
Microsoft .NET Framework 4</span>  
  
In this session, [Drew
Robbins](http://geekswithblogs.net/drewby/Default.aspx) gave an overview
of things new in .NET 4.  
  
You can find a full list of new features and improvements in .NET 4 in
[this MSDN
article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171868.aspx).  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">A lap around Windows IE9 for
developers</span>  
  
[Pete Lepage](http://petelepage.com/blog/) gave us a lap around IE9. He
told us that with this version of IE, Microsoft is trying to focus on
three things:

-   Using the whole pc (GPU!)
-   Creating a site-centric UI
-   Being compliant with the standards
    ([HTML5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html) &
    [CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-roadmap/))

His presentation <span style="font-style:italic;">should</span> be
available on [his blog](http://petelepage.com/blog/) tonight.  
  
To get some more insight on what IE9 is all about, check the website
[Beauty of the Web](http://beautyoftheweb.com/). Also don't forget to
[download the beta version of
IE9](http://www.beautyoftheweb.com/#/download)! It really is the best
browser out there.  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">The future of C\#</span>  
  
Mads Torgersen talked about the future of C\#. Version 5 of C\# will be
all about asynchronous programming.  
  
To learn more, watch
[this](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Mads-Torgersen-Inside-C-Async)
video on [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/) called "Inside C\#
Async". If you want to go deeper, [Jon
Skeet](http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/) did several very low-level
blog posts on this topic [this
month](http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/11.aspx).  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Software testing with VS2010</span>  
  
This was part 1 of 2 on software testing with VS2010. In this first part
[Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/) mainly talked about
Microsoft Test Manager. This tool helps you plan, test, track and
organize manual tests. Its integration with Team Foundation makes this a
tool which I want to start using in the near future.  
  
To see what I am talking about, you can watch [the
video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/kmcgrath/Introduction-to-Test-Case-Management-in-Visual-Studio-2010-with-Microsoft-Test-and-Lab-Manager)
"Introduction to Test Case Management in Visual Studio 2010 with
Microsoft Test and Lab Manager" on [Channel
9](http://channel9.msdn.com/).  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Building great websites fast using
Umbraco</span>  
  
[Umbraco](http://umbraco.org/) is an Open Source CMS written in ASP.NET.
It serves 85.000 websites, including
[Peugeot.com](http://www.peugeot.com/en.aspx) and
[Asp.net](http://www.asp.net/).  
  
The founder of Umbraco, Niels Hartvig, gave this session. Next to
showing us how to set up a basic new website with Umbraco, he also made
an exciting announcement. In the near future Umbraco will support [Razor
syntax](http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/tutorials/2-introduction-to-asp-net-web-programming-using-the-razor-syntax)!  
  
As Niels told us, Umbraco has a great community, so the best place to
start playing and learning is [the Umbraco community
website](http://our.umbraco.org/).  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">F\# in VS2010</span>  
  
Microsoft shipped
[F\#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)) as a
first class citizen of the .NET languages in Visual Studio 2010. F\# is
a functional language which tries to solve complex problems with simple
code.  
  
[Don Syme](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/) showed us how to get started
with F\#. To get started yourself, visit the [F\# Developer
Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/fsharp/default.aspx).  
  
He also talked about the future of F\#, where Type providers look very
cool and innovative. You can watch his session on the future of F\# at
PDC
[here](http://player.microsoftpdc.com/Session/04092962-4ed1-42c6-be07-203d42115274).  
  
  
<span style="font-style:italic;">I plan on posting the most interesting
stuff here daily this week, so stay tuned! </span>
