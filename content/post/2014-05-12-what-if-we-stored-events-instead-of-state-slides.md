I just returned from Croatia, where I got to speak twice at the second
edition of [The Geek Gathering](http://2014.thegeekgathering.org/).  
  
Being such a young conference, I had no idea what to expect really.
Turns out they have a good thing going on; a small, local and very
personal approach to conferences. Speakers both local and international,
covering topics that serve the community, not their employer.  
  
Together with Tom, I preached [Alberto](https://twitter.com/ziobrando)'s
Event Storming during a four hour long workshop. As always, people were
impressed by how quick you can gain an understanding of a new domain
using this technique. Slides of this workshop will be online after I
make some tweaks, and try it in Paris on Friday.  
  
In my second talk, I got to share what I've learned these last two years
on event sourcing. You can find the slides of that talk embedded below
or on
[Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/jclaes/what-if-we-stored-events-instead-of-state).
Thanks [Tom](https://twitter.com/ToJans),
[Mathias](https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes),
[Stijn](https://twitter.com/one75),
[Yves](https://twitter.com/yreynhout) and
[Bart](https://twitter.com/bwaterschoot) for reviewing them!
