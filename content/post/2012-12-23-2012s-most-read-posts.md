I look forward to writing this post each year; it's by far the easiest
one to write, and it provides me with an occasion to look back on
previous years
([2009](http://www.jefclaes.be/2009/12/high-5-five-most-popular-blog-posts-of.html),
[2010](http://www.jefclaes.be/2010/12/top-5-popular-posts-of-2010.html),
[2011](http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/12/2011s-most-read-posts.html)). It's
entertaining - and shameful too - to see what kept me busy back then,
which opinions I held, and which technologies and techniques are still
relevant in the meanwhile. Anyways, here it goes.  
  
The most read post this year, with 37.797 page views, is [How a web
application can download and store over 2GB without you even knowing
it](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/03/how-web-application-can-download-and.html).
I just ran this experiment again with the latest Chrome build, and
apparently the Chrome team hasn't addressed these concerns in the
meanwhile; the browser still behaves exactly the same. I'm guessing
usage stats might prove that it's not worth the effort.  
  
The second most read post, with 14.371 page views, is [Learning: the
Hacker Way](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/03/learning-hacker-way.html). I
still firmly stand by this one today. Passive learning can only take you
so far; it's crucial to supplement passive learning with a high volume
of getting your hands dirty.  
  
With 14.085 page views, [Commuting: have you done the
math?](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/11/commuting-have-you-done-math.html)
comes in third. Commuting wastes a good part of your life; optimizing
your commute can significantly improve the quality of your average day.
Readers shared some interesting experiences in the comments on this
one.  
  
Having 5.215 page views, the post [Why I will always love
RSS](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/05/why-i-will-always-love-rss.html) is
the penultimate item in this list. This writing is basically a rant on
how, although I somewhat understand the motivation behind public
companies fencing their gardens, it is sad to see that even peers seem
to advertise the death of RSS, while it's RSS that has enabled me to
follow my favorite sources of information without having to rely on
others to tell me what to read, and without having to be connected the
whole damn time.  
  
With 1000 views less, making it the last item in the list, is the post
[HTML5 Offline Web applications as an afterthought in ASP.NET
MVC](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/03/html5-offline-web-applications-as.html).
It was this post that landed me a [paid article on
InfoQ](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/03/html5-offline-web-applications-as.html).
I should revisit this topic again, I'm curious to see how many websites
are already making use of this HTML5 super cache to improve performance,
or to truly provide offline access.  
  
Thank *you* for reading in 2012!
