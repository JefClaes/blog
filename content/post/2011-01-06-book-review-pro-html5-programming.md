The [Apress](http://apress.com/) book [Pro HTML5
Programming](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430227907?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1430227907)
was written by three authors: [Peter
Lubbers](http://runlaketahoe.blogspot.com/), Brian Albers and [Frank
Salim](http://www.franksalim.com/). In this book the authors introduce
the reader to the most popular and useful features of HTML5.  
  
The book contains 11 concise chapters: An overview of HTML5, the Canvas
API, audio and video, the Geolocation API, the Communication API, the
WebSocket API, Forms, the Web Workers API, the Web Storage API, Offline
Web Applications and the future of HTML5.  
  
This book succeeds in breaking the myth that HTML5 will not be
applicable until 2022. The authors demonstrate this by accompanying all
theory with a ton of examples based on realistic scenarios. The examples
are not to complex, and most of the time, cut in well sized pieces,
which makes them easy to digest. The authors show you how to detect
whether a certain feature is supported by the hosting browser. They do
not provide information on fallback mechanismes though, which I think is
a good thing, because it would only break the tight scoping of the
book.  
  
Developers who are new to HTML and JavaScript should pick up

first, some experience with client-side webdevelopement is adviced.  
  
I think this book is a good read and can serve as an excellent
introduction to HTML5. You should [get

before it's obsolete ;).  
  
**My rating: 4/5.**
