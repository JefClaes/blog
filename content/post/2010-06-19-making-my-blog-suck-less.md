Today [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) did a session on
blogging at the
[BWB](http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&q=blogging+while+brown&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=)
(Blogging While Brown - yah seriously!) conference. He tweeted a link to
the slides of this session. I embedded the slides in this post, but you
can also get them from
[here](http://www.slideshare.net/shanselman/32-ways-to-make-your-blog-suck-less).  
  
Take your time to check out the slides. It's actually a bit of a
checklist, so it shouldn't take more than two minutes.  
  

  
  
The slides pointed out a few things that were missing on my blog..  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Have your contact info
somewhere</span>  
  
First you could only reach me through Twitter. Now you can directly
[send me an e-mail](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/p/contact.html) through
my blog. I used [Kontactr](http://kontactr.com/index.php).

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Have an About Me page</span>  
  
I added an [About Me](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html) page.
It is short and concise, but I plan on upgrading it in the near
future.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Integrate Search</span>  
  
I added a Google Search widget, which should make it easy to search my
blog.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">What about you?</span>  
  
Do you have any feedback on the changes? Are there things you are able
to improve on your blog?
