Yesterday, I gave a talk on WebSockets at HTML5 WebCamps Belgium.  
  
> **WebSockets on Fire**  
>   
> While the WebSockets API specification is not stable yet, various
> browser vendors have already implemented a prototype in their latest
> browser versions. Microsoft released their WebSockets prototype in
> December 2010. While there is no native implementation of WebSockets
> in IE9 just yet, for now they are providing a solution which works
> cross-browser, relying on a Silverlight client. Server-side a Windows
> Communication Foundation server is made available, which implements
> the latest version of the WebSockets protocol.  
>   
> In this session, Jef covers the WebSockets fundamentals, demonstrates
> a proof of concept that could be used in various fire department web
> applications and deep-dives into the code of this proof of concept.

You can already find the video of my session on [Channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/liese/HTML5-Web-Camp-Belgium-WebSockts-on-Fire). The slides can be found on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/jclaes/websockets-on-fire).  
  
If you want to play with the demo yourself, you can [download the
source](#):
- Make sure your firewall allows incoming TCP traffic on port 4502
- Deploy the client access policy file to IIS
- Also host the Demo.WebSockets.WebClient in IIS

More information on installing the WebSockets prototype [here](#).
