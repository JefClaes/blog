[HTML5 WebCamps](http://msdn.microsoft.com/nl-be/gg637927) is a **free**
event organized by Microsoft Belgium and will take place on April 6th at
[Living Tomorrow](http://www.livingtomorrow.be/).  
  
In my session I will be talking about WebSockets.  

> **WebSockets on Fire**  
>   
> While the WebSockets API specification is not stable yet, various
> browser vendors have already implemented a prototype in their latest
> browser versions. Microsoft released their WebSockets prototype in
> December 2010. While there is no native implementation of WebSockets
> in IE9 just yet, for now they are providing a solution which works
> cross-browser, relying on a Silverlight client. Server-side a Windows
> Communication Foundation server is made available, which implements
> the latest version of the WebSockets protocol.  
>   
> In this session, Jef covers the WebSockets fundamentals, demonstrates
> a proof of concept that could be used in various fire department web
> applications and deep-dives into the code of this proof of concept.
