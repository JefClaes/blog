I found [this story on
Quora](http://www.quora.com/Disneyland/What-are-some-amazing-secrets-hidden-within-Disneyland-and-Disney-World/answer/Nic-DiPalma?srid=3XUe&share=1)
a few weeks ago, and thought it was a testament to how observing -
instead of assuming - can save you a lot of effort, and will end up
serving the users best.  

  

In the first product I helped building, there had been lots and lots of
requirements gathering before we got to build the first functionality.
Once we rolled out the pieces to the first set of users, they were
disappointed to say the least - enraged actually; "This not usable at
all! Do you even know what you're doing?". Apparently requirements were
made up by people higher in rank, without consulting those who would
have to use the software on a day-to-day basis. Not the best move
getting buy-in from actual users, but I can't really blame them either;
requirements are hard, often times you're just making stuff up as you go
along - with best intentions. Being in a crisis, we got to learn a lot
the next few months. One of us got sent out to the customer location a
few times, and got to observe how they were trying to use our software.
That information proved to be invaluable, and gave us enough to start
shipping better and more useful software. Users felt empowered by our
software, eventually leading to earning their trust and approval.

  

Another example can be found in my current project - which is not that
visible to users, but more behind the scenes. Instead of guessing
performance targets, it's by observing production metrics that we're
able to set realistic goals.

  

Observing instead of assuming usually leads to better results. Keep in
mind that you can misinterpret what you're observing too, and that there
often is no other option than to assume. You can still avoid overly
expensive mistakes, by validating these assumptions as early as
possible.
