Yesterday we cruised along the eastern coastline of [Lake
Garda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Garda). Plan A was to visit
[Malcesine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcesine) and take the
cableway up to the top of [Monte
Baldo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Baldo), but since the line at
the ticket center resembled one of a Justin Bieber concert, we skipped
the cableway. Maybe we'll give it another try later this week, but then
earlier in the day. We continued our journey along the coast, passing
past several genuinely picturesque villages. We stopped in Garda for an
elaborate lake side lunch, before continuing to our last destination
that day, [Sirmione](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmione). There we
visited the medieval castello Scaligero and after climbing the numerous
steps inside the castle, we rewarded ourselves with an oversized typical
Italian gelato.

Today we made a trip to [Venice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice).
After a 2 hour drive, we parked our car at Venezia Mestre train station,
to enter the Floating City by train. We soon found ourselves lost in a
maze of fairy alleys and waterways, searching for the main tourist
attractions. First we headed for the Mercato Rialto, which is probably
the best market in the world, but we can’t confirm that since it was
already cleared out when we got there at 2PM. After having some
delicious fresh fruit at the foot of the [ponte di
Rialto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto_Bridge), we crossed the
famous bridge stacked with souvenir shops. Arriving at Piazza San Marco,
we took the time to visit the impressive [basilica San
Marco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark%27s_Basilica) and the
gigantesque [Doge's
palace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge%27s_Palace,_Venice). While
these classics were definitely worthwhile, you can't miss out on
strolling around the less tourist neighborhoods to experience the
authentic Venice.
