After seventeen days, 2000 miles (3220km), seven states, eight national
parks and fifteen motels, our
[second](http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/once-upon-time-in-west.html) USA
road trip has come to an end. Inspired, and with new insights, we're
leaving for Belgium in the morning.  
  
Along the way, we documented our journey in these posts:

Thanks for reading! When I return, I'll get back to more technical
writing.
