As a technology geek, it should be hard to keep ignoring the latest
generation of eReaders (read: [the
Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FQJT3Q?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002FQJT3Q)).
With [over three million devices
sold](http://blogs.siliconvalley.com/gmsv/2010/01/amazon-updates-kindle-sales-figures-from-lots-to-millions.html),
the Kindle has proven that it adds value to people's lives, and that
it's a lot more than just a gadget.  
  
Some of the most obvious benefits... You can carry a whole library in
your backpack. The price of an eBook often is substantially less than
the hardcover version. I am far from a Green, but I can't neglect the
fact that no trees need to be chopped down to print an eBook. Reading a
1000+ page book in bed or next to the pool is the opposite of
convenient.  
  
Sufficient arguments to get a Kindle, but still, I just can't. Like
serial killers [collect trophies of their
victims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(TV_series)#Series_outset),
I want to collect every book I have ever read. Unlike serial killers, I
want to exhibit every trophy. I catch myself regularly halting for a few
minutes when I pass by my bookcase. I love to have a look at the
bookspines and associate the title with the time and place I read the
book. Part of my love for paper books might also be caused by the global
perception that books equal wisdom.
