Me and [Tom](https://twitter.com/tojans) just finished doing our Event
storming workshop at [NCrafts Paris](http://ncrafts.io/). Although we
made a few mistakes along the way, feedback on the workshop was great. I
hope to put something out about what we learned facilitating later this
week. People talked, discovered and eventually learned a new domain in
under two hours. The domain? Two minutes before the workshop we found a
domain expert prepared to talk about his coupon start-up.  

> Modeling a business process is often associated with people in suits
> having long and dull meetings. Way too much time gets wasted for an
> outcome that's far from reality and which will be obsolete in weeks.
> Event storming is a workshop format that brings modeling back to all
> stakeholders, and aims to create usable models.  
>
> In this workshop, you won't be writing any code, but you will be using
> lots of paper, post-its and a marker. After going over a bit of theory
> and a small example, we will present you with a real business problem,
> and in a few short playful sessions you will experience how powerful
> event storming can be in helping a team gain insight into complex
> problems.
>  
> The techniques you will learn in this workshop will pay off
> immediately. 

The slides we used are now up on
