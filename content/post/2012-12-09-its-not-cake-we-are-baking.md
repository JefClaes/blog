I recently watched a talk on Vimeo where [Christin
Gorman](https://twitter.com/ChristinGorman) talks about how cookie dough
relates to Hibernate; why use the generic, bloated and one-fits-all
solution when you can mix together your own yummy cookie dough? We
should aspire to be the Gordon Ramsey of software, not the college
student who can only cook Ramen noodles. If you haven't watched or
listened to her talk, you should; it's only a few minutes long, and she
brings it really well. [Go ahead](http://vimeo.com/28885655), I'll
wait.  
  
When I first watched her talk, it rubbed me the wrong way, but I
couldn't yet figure out the flaw in her plea. It recently dawned upon me
that we are not in the business of baking cakes, but we are in the
business of serving hungry people. And those people really don't care
which ingredients were used to bake your cake; they only care about how
it tastes, how fast it's served, and how much they're paying for it. And
although the romantic in me really sympathizes with her view, the
realist just can't. Over these few years only, each and every attempt of
a hand-rolled ORM I've seen, ended with a horrible aftertaste. There is
no way that you spend as much time building a good API from scratch as
you do setting up an existing one. Writing and maintaining your own ORM
is [not a trivial thing to
do](http://ayende.com/blog/1340/25-reasons-not-to-write-your-own-object-relational-mapper),
and there are already so many flavors\* - from grandma's recipe to
decadent supreme deluxe - to pick from, that it's hardly ever a
justified decision. Read the package and choose the option that
satisfies your daily caloric needs, and go from there. You can still
sweeten, or swap some ingredients, before serving. And if you really
can't resist - which is perfectly healthy, bake all the cake you want,
at home. Maybe, one day, you can bring a successful one to work.
