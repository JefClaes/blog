In this post I'm going to reflect on the year that's almost finished and
the year to come.  
  
I came up with a few topics that are worth discussing in this post.  
  
### My career
  
I don't think I ever mentioned where I work. The first of January I will
be working 18 months for [Ferranti](http://www.ferranti.be). The only company I've worked for since I graduated.  
  
The first project I've ever worked on was a rather big one. [Firestation
Antwerp](http://www.bloggen.be/brandweerantwerpen/). Last year we heard
that sales scored another firestation for us ([Firestation Ghent](http://www.brandweergent.be/)). So I've been working on these two projects since I started.  
  
Do these projects get boring? Well, not boring, exhausting maybe. These
projects are very complex (Dispatching, telecommunication, web applications,
GIS, ..) and the requirements are very high. Although these projects are
exhausting from time to time, I don't think there are other projects
where I would've learned as much in such a small period of time. As a
developer I have touched and worked on lots of stuff: ASP.NET,
WindowsServices, WCF, WebServices, GIS, API's, Telecommunication.. You
name it.  
  
### Blog
  
I've been blogging since October 2008. When I just started out
the quality of the content was rather poor. Although I'm not totally
satisfied with the content I produced this year, I hope the quality has
improved noticeable. I saw the traffic increase significantly this year,
so I hope that's a good sign.  
  
There are a few posts that scored pretty good out there. You can find
them [here](#). 

By blogging I've made lots of new friends. I enjoy reading through all
of your Tweets. [Bart De Smet](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/Default.aspx) in particular has been a very good mentor.  
  
### Community
  
I managed to go to two events this year:  
- TechDays Belgium  
- Scott Guthrie in Belgium

I hope I will get the opportunity to go to some big event next year. I
also plan on going to more [VISUG](http://www.visug.be/) sessions.  
  
I've been neglecting the [ASP.NET forums](http://forums.asp.net/)
lately. In general I think the quality of the questions is rather poor
and there are plenty of good answerers. I've been a long time
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) lurker. Next year I'll try to
contribute to that community.  
  
### Travelling
  
I managed to travel four times this year:  

- France (Albi)
- [Spain (Madrid)](https://jefclaes.be/2009/11/my-trip-to-madrid-in-ten-pictures.html)
- Belgium (Ardennes)
- France (Normandie)

In 2010 I'll try to go abroad at least three times.  
  
### Wrap up 
  
In general, my year was pretty fun. I hope 2010 will be at least as good. Excited about hearing how you did this year and what you hope to achieve in 2010!
