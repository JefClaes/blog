After a strenuous drive from Los Angeles to San Diego, we took advantage
of the mild climate to unwind at San Diego’s
[Aquatica](http://seaworldparks.com/en/aquatica-sandiego).

  
Being the 4<sup>th</sup> of July, we joined the festivities and watched
the fireworks from the car. Sadly we didn’t get to see a redo of last
year’s spectacle, when [San Diego accidentally launched all its
fireworks in 30 seconds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndVhgq1yHdA).

Next we headed for [Joshua Tree National
Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Tree_National_Park). With
temperatures flirting with 100°F (38°C), we took on one small hike and
drove up to two viewpoints; Skull Rock and Key’s View. Driving through
cities of the plain in the California desert, we stopped in Barstow for
some Mexican food and Corona, to finally faceplant in our pillows.

This morning we got up early to hunt down some ghosts in the silver town
of [Calico](http://cms.sbcounty.gov/parks/Parks/CalicoGhostTown.aspx).
Too bad they couldn’t keep the ghost town more authentic.
