Although I've made my feet wet with various JavaScript frameworks, I am
not a JavaScript hero at all. This might be one of the disadvantages of
being a WebForms developer and having great toolkits at hand like the
[AJAX Control
Toolkit](http://www.asp.net/(S(fu2l2uzphr2u3u45q2dnez55))/ajax/AjaxControlToolkit/Samples/)
and Telerik RADControls.  
  
Because you really can't call yourself a webdeveloper without having
some understanding of JavaScript I decided to order Object-Oriented
Javascript by [Stoyan Stefanov](http://www.phpied.com/).  
  
This book really handles the language itself. The first chapters handle
the basics: Types, loops, functions and objects. Although these concepts
and the syntax resemble C\#, JavaScript is a total different beast.
After covering the basics, Stoyan goes deeper into OO JavaScript with
Prototype and Inheritance. Then he shows the Browser Environment and he
finishes the book with Coding and Design patterns.  
  
All these concepts are accompanied by a ton of easy-to-read examples.
After every chapter he also gives you some homework, because you learn
coding by coding. After finishing this book you can also use the
excellent Appendix for your reference.  
  
I thought this was a great and very complete book. Definitely one of the
best software books I've read in a while.
