This Christmas, my girlfriend and I got this little book called [It's
not how good you are, it's how good you want to
be](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0714843377/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0714843377).

This book is mainly directed to (advertisement) designers, but since I
feel that designers and developers do have a few things in common, we
both like to create things, I also read it.  
  
The content of this book is a collection of [Paul Ardens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Arden) observations on business and life presented in a *very* consumable format. As it turns out, although I am not part of the target audience, a good amount of his thoughts can be applied to software development as well.  
  
Find a few of these thought-provoking quotes below.  

> If you are involved in something that goes wrong, never blame others.
> Blame no one but yourself.

> Give away everything you know, and more will come back to you.

> Don't look for the next opportunity. The one you have in hand is the
> opportunity.

> The person who doesn't make mistakes is unlikely to make anything.

> If you get stuck, draw with a different pen.

> Don't be afraid to work with the best.
