With this last post, our trip to Italy has come to an end. We have spent
these last few days practicing several indispensable tourist activities:
testing the ice cold lake water, to wriggle between other sunbathers on
the packed beach right after, exuberant eating and drinking, reading
novels, and sauntering between prullaria shops.  
  
Fortuitously, one of our last evenings here was upgraded by fireworks
over an already moonlit Lake Garda. This outlying location gave the
fireworks show an extra notch. With each firework rocket, the pitch dark
beach was illuminated for a few seconds. With each bang, the sound
echoed over the mountains, making the water ripple to strand in the
pebble beach eventually.
