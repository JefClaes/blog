After exploring the USA’s West Coast [two years
ago](http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/once-upon-time-in-west.html), we
felt like we had to pay a second visit to fill in some blanks.

We left Antwerp Sunday 7AM to touch down 25 hours later in LAX, after an
eight hour cross-Atlantic flight to Newark and a six hour overlay
waiting for a connecting flight.

We were welcomed by a rental car salesman who strongly advised us to
upgrade to a bigger SUV which would give us tinted windows since *it’s
gonna be hot, you know*. After politely blowing him off, we drove off to
our first hotel. Arriving at an airport motel, we got to check off the
clichés with a lost empty beer bottle in the room, and us playing ‘the
stained carpet is lava’.

We started off our first day with a real American breakfast; eggs and
steak. Saturated, we continued our path to the California Science
Center, driving through LA’s colorful suburbs. Arriving there, we found
the highly welcomed Space Shuttle named
[Endeavour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour) in its
retirement home. We also visited the IMAX theatre, which is always worth
your while. This time we got to see [Blue
Planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Planet_(film)). We followed
this up with a small lunch at LA’s real farmer’s market.

Yesterday we took part in a Warner Bros VIP tour. With a group of only
eleven, the guide did a great job making the tour a lot more intimate
than the one Universal offers. Cruising through the outdoor sets, he
emphasized once again how fake everything is. A small patch of grass
serves as Central Park; outdoor stages can be stripped down and rebuilt
to go from 18<sup>th</sup>century San Francisco to nowadays New York in
a couple of days; leaves are plucked from trees to make it Winter and
sewed back on to fast-forward to Spring; cracks are drilled into new
pavements, and patches of tar are put on, to make them look worn out.
Besides the outdoor stages we got a close look at the Big Bang Theory
set and the retired Friends props, we even got to sit on the famous
couch. Our final look behind the scenes went to the retired car museum,
which was a real treat for me as a Batman fan, since it housed all
Batmobiles, even the Tumbler.

After that, we drove up to Hollywood Boulevard, to be washed over by
thousands of tourists walking around Hollywood’s two most famous
theatres - the Dolby (former Kodak) theatre, and the Chinese theatre –
just to stand where the stars once stood.

After nightfall we drove up to the observatory, just to put the size of
LA in perspective. We were also hoping for some romance, but so were
hundreds of others apparently.

Today we left central LA for Santa Monica and Venice Beach. We started
our boardwalk in Venice Beach, embracing beach culture: street
performers, medical marihuana offices, hustlers and amateurs pumping
iron at Muscle Beach.
