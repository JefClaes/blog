Two junior developers who started working for the company at the same
time, had been quite competitive with each other from the get-go. They
had once been assigned to the same team, but because of the constant
bickering, which had put a serious amount of stress on the team, one of
them was pulled off the project and reassigned.  
  
A good year later, just the two of them were assigned to a new smallish,
but interesting in-house project. When management assigned them to the
same project again, they had just been shuffling resources around, and
had no idea of the history these two had. An architect was also assigned
to the project, but this was not more than a formality. As soon as the
enterprise architecture diagram was updated and the paper work was out
of the way, he would do an official hand over, but he would only
occasionally check in on the project from then on.  
  
The Friday morning after the hand over, the architect was making small
talk with one of the project managers in the coffee corner. His agenda
for the day was almost empty - exactly how he liked it on Fridays. He
planned on making the rounds this morning to check in on projects he was
involved with, to attend a meeting at noon, and to spend the afternoon
reading up on micro services, for then to go home early. While he
charged the coffee machine with another coffee pod, he heard an uproar
that had to be coming from the other side of the floor. He couldn't
quite make out what it was about, but he recognized the voices
immediately: the two juniors.  
  
He hurried over to the source of the noise. Prying eyes looked curiously
over their monitors, ignoring the architect as he passed by. He found
the two juniors standing next to the white board, yelling at each other,
gesturing vigorously, crossing out parts of the drawings. The architect
broke up the fight, and commanded them to get in the meeting room right
away. Startled at first, but red-faced just a few seconds later, they
shuffled towards the meeting room, not saying one more word, staring at
their shoes.  
  
The architect closed the door behind him, and started questioning them.
What was this all about? He learned they had a big disagreement on how
they should design a part of the new system. The architect, after
hearing them out, thought he understood both their solutions. Given the
information he had at that time, he thought both solutions were good
enough for now - each made trade-offs, and only time would tell them
more.  
"There are still dozens of possible alternatives out there. I should try
to show them how to come to a consensus together," he thought. "Before I
do that, I'm curious to discover their incentives though, so let me try
something here."  
  
He told them that he liked both of their solutions, but that he couldn't
decide Â which was the better one. Instead, he would take random parts of
each solution and throw them together, to come up with a hybrid
solution. This way, nobody loses.  
  
Junior number one seemed relieved. He nodded and glanced at his partner.
To his surprise, his partner didn't look very happy. Junior number two
blurted out that he'd rather see his own solution in the bin, than to
give up conceptual integrity, just because two people can't agree.  
  
With that, the architect learned that junior number one had fallen into
the trap of making it personal, and was trying to save face. Number two
however, was wise enough to favor conceptual integrity over getting his
way. The architect complimented the kid, and acknowledged that sometimes
giving in might be the wise thing to do - not always, you have to pick
your battles. Then he rolled up his sleeves, picked up a bunch of
post-its and a pen for both of them and said that it was time for them
to "fight the problem together instead of fighting each other". But not
before he made another coffee.
