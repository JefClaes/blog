These skyscrapers are, other than the enormous mountains, the redwood
[sequoia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens) on top of
them. Some of these trees are the same height as a thirty story
building, which is higher than the Statue Of Liberty. It's almost
impossible to capture these giants on camera.

After a short hike between the sequoia, we drove off to [Yosemite Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_Valley) to discover the Yosemity Falls. Although the falls must be more impressive in Winter, they were still worth visiting.

Today we drove through Yosemite National Park once again, this time on
our way to cross the border to Nevada. On the route, we came across
breathtaking swirling roads.

Just before crossing the border to Nevada, we stopped at two [Mono
Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_Lake) vista points.

Tomorrow, we are continuing our trip to [Zion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_National_Park).
