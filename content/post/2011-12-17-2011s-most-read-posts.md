I compiled a list of most popular posts that were published on this blog
in 2011. Unlike [last
year](https://www.jefclaes.be/2010/12/top-5-popular-posts-of-2010.html),
and [the year before
that](https://www.jefclaes.be/2009/12/high-5-five-most-popular-blog-posts-of.html),
this year it's not a strict top five list. While analyzing the
statistics, I found out that a few topics -covered over multiple posts -
were popular this year.  
  
Preparing for [my HTML5 Webcamps session on
WebSockets](https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/04/video-slides-and-source-from-my.html),
I wrote a few posts on the Microsoft WebSockets prototype. I published
[a step-by-step guide on how to get the prototype
working](https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/01/html5-installing-microsoft-websockets.html)
on your machine. A little later I also published two posts covering the
internals of the
[client](https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/01/html5-websockets-prototype-with.html)
and
[server](https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/01/html5-rebuilding-websockets-server.html)
WebSockets prototype. I'm not surprised search drove a lot of traffic to
these posts. Microsoft hardly tried to make it easy to play with the
prototype: no tutorials, no source, nothing. Now the specification is
stable, and WCF 4.5 has WebSockets support out of the box, I suspect MS
will make greater evangelizing efforts. Or maybe, they will wait [until
one of their browsers support
it](https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/03/how-will-ie9-maintain-momentum.html).  
  
In [this post](https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/building-small-things.html) I
rambled on how liberating it can be to build something small on your own
now and then, just to keep your sanity and escape from software in the
real world. This post got picked up by Hacker News, making it the second
entry in this list.  
  
In one of those sporadic academic moments, I had a look at one of the
[quirks in anonymous type
equality](https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/04/anonymous-type-equality.html).
I also looked at the reason [why anonymous types can be compared in the
first
place](https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/04/anonymous-type-equality-follow-up.html),
being reference types after all.  
  
To wrap up this link collection, I would like to **thank you for reading**. I hope to see you contribute to this little outlet of mine for another year.
