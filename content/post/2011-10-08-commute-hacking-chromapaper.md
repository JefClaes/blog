Since I [changed
jobs](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2011/08/high-hopes.html), I do my daily
commute by train. This adds two hours of leasure time to the day, which
I used to lose in traffic.  
  
So far, I have been spending these two won hours programming and/or
reading. I have been looking for a way to read online content offline on
my laptop. Searching for software that could make this happen, I mostly
came across programs which would mirror a whole site locally. Eventually
I asked Twitter, and [Lee Dumond](http://twitter.com/#!/leedumond)
pointed me to Chromapaper.  
  
Chromapaper is a free Chrome application which caches Instapaper entries
locally. Through the day, I mark interesting, but lenghty articles for
reading later, so that I can simply synchronise them to my machine
before leaving the connected cocoon.  
  
You can find the
[Instapaper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fldildgghjoohccppflaohodcnmlacpb?hl=en-US&hc=search&hcp=main)
and the
[Chromapaper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fldildgghjoohccppflaohodcnmlacpb?hl=en-US&hc=search&hcp=main)Â plugins
in the Chrome Web Store.
