While I'm writing this, the girlfriend and I are on our way from San
Francisco to [Yosemite National
Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park). We have
spent two full days visiting 'Fog City'. During these two intensive days
we were able to see everything we aimed for, maybe more.  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Financial District</span>  
  
This part of town is definitely worth a visit. The multiplicity of
skyscrapers merging into the San Francisco fog, is an impressive view.
When the fog has gone, the shadows the buildings cast on each other are
just as amazing.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Pier 39</span>  
  
While obviously [a tourist trap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_39),
I found strolling through the shops and restaurants on the pier to be
surprisingly amusing.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Alcatraz Island</span>  
  
One of the main attractions of San Francisco, and a must see. If you
plan on taking a tour on [the
island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz_Island), you must make
reservations a few days ahead. We failed to do that, and ended up taking
a cruise around Alcatraz Island. I feel like we missed out, but the boat
tour was definitely good value for money too.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">SS Jeremiah O'Brien</span>  
  
Not so far from Pier 39, you can find a very nicely preserved World War
II liberty ship. If you have been on one of those ships before, it might
not be worth the 10 bucks.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Lombard Street</span>  
  
[Th√© most famous street in San
Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_(San_Francisco)),
but kind of overrated. Save yourself the steep hill climb, and try
finding a view from a few blocks away.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Chinatown</span>  
  
Always a charming neighbourhood to window shop small boutiques for
Chinese kitsch.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Golden Gate Bridge</span>  
  
An [amazing piece of
architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge). Can you
imagine building that in the thirties? We drove there by bike, very
recommended. Not for the faint of heart though.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Palace of Fine Arts</span>  
  
On your way to the Golden Gate Bridge, you should drop by the [Palace of
Fine Arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Fine_Arts).

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Trivia</span>  
  
If Anonymous isn't hacking the Sony network, they are
[protesting](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2391160,00.asp) in the
streets of San Francisco.

I hope this post might have given you some ideas on locations to visit
[when you're going to San
Francisco](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bch1_Ep5M1s).
