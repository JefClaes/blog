on HTML5 offline web applications earlier this year, I got contacted by
[InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/) to write an in-detail article on the
subject for them. I hesitated at first, because I was afraid that it
would feel too much like work, taking the fun out of my writing. Turns
out it wasn't like that at all. The guys at infoQ were really relaxed to
work with, asking interesting questions and giving useful feedback,
without forcing me into a certain direction. A pleasant experience.
