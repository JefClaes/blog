We’re past halfway our trip and we need to make headway if we want to
stay on schedule and reach Yellowstone by Sunday. Long, but pleasant
drives; [if you’re used to Belgian
traffic](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2013/04/25/the-worlds-most-traffic-congested-cities/).  
  
Yesterday we visited [Capitol Reef National
Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Reef_National_Park). We
originally planned on doing the Hickman Bridge Trail, but apparently
there had recently been a big rock fall, blocking access at the
trailhead. As an alternative we did the Narrows trail at Grand Wash
Road, which was carved by a stream ages ago and is now still sometimes
victim to flashfloods. Afterwards, we followed the scenic route, which
made us zigzag between big boulders, on- and off-road.  
  
In the evening we arrived at
touristy [Moab](http://www.moabcity.state.ut.us/), going to dinner felt
a lot like home, being surrounded by Dutch-speaking people. The
temperature and the view gave away our true location though.

This morning, instead of hiking, we chose another means of
transportation: we rented a UTV (Utility Vehicle). This allowed us to
explore the Sand Flats Recreation Area, maneuvering over slick rocks and
small desert dunes, following a trail of black skid marks. We completed
the Hell’s Revenge Trail, which lives up to its name; it was
frighteningly exciting.

Since this already took up a big chunk of our day and we still had a
four hour drive to Salt Lake City ahead of us, we had to do the [Arches
National Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arches_National_Park) scenic
drive in the fast lane.
