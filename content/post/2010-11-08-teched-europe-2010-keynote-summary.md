The Keynote made it very clear how important the cloud might/will be for
the industry the following years. The presenter [Brad
Anderson](https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/AndersonB/) even
compared [the Cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) with
the invention of electricity, enough said.  
  
Microsoft sees the Cloud delivering three core services:

-   [SaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service): Software
    as a service
-   [IaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure):
    Infrastructure as a service
-   [PaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service):
    Platforms as a service

Below you can find a list of new products that were demoed during the
Keynote. Next to the Windows 7 Phone and SQL Azure all these products
were new to me and one by one they looked <span
