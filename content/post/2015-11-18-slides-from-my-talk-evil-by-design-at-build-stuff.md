Third time attending Build Stuff, first time doing a talk. I'm happy
that it's out of the way and can now just enjoy the conference, but I'm
even more excited that it was well-received! The talk should have been
recorded, but you can already find the abstract and slides below.  

> Last year I ventured into the domain of (online) gambling. Given that
> the industry has been around since forever, I expected most problems
> to be of the technical kind. As it turned out, the struggle with
> technology was only part of a bigger problem; to move forward we
> needed to fully grasp the industry and its consumers. Events started out as a way to dismantle a legacy system, but quickly
> proved to be an effective tool to gain a deeper understanding of our
> domain. Visualising event streams, we discovered patterns that helped
> us identify what drives different types of users. Having a better understanding of what customers are looking for, we
> dove into existing literature to learn which techniques and models
> casinos use to cater for each type of user. We learned how to program
> chance while staying true to the Random Number God. Even when variance
> is brutal, casinos have enough data and tools to steer clear from the
> pain barrier. All of this entails interesting problems and software, but isn't my
> code damaging society? Or is gambling just another human trait?
