While I have - obviously - read the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) before, and regularly click through to articles on agile, I had never read an extensive work on it. Browsing for a good book, I was advised by a peer to get [The Art of Agile Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596527675/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596527675).  
  
I wholeheartedly believe in the Agile Manifesto, but somewhere along the way Agile - with a capital A - got somewhat of a bad rep. The authors of this book, [James Shore](http://jamesshore.com/) and Shane Warden, already predicted this five years ago. Throughout the book, I never had the feeling they were connected to the Agile mob, but just genuinely care about working software.

The book consists of three parts: getting started, practicing XP and
mastering agility. Notice the title of the second part, this is a book
on agile development using the [Extreme Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) methodology. This should be mentioned in the title.
 
The second part is also the dominant chunk of the book - 271 pages to be precise -, in which 37 agile development practices are covered. These
practices are bundled into five categories: thinking, collaborating,
releasing, planning and developing. Each practice follows the same
recipe: breakdown, questions, results, contraindications, alternatives
and further reading. These recipes go into detail, making this book
suitable as a reference. As a result, it often also reads as reference
material; I found it hard at times to stay attentive. The material is a
bit tedious, sometimes a bit repetitive, and while some of the real
world experiences are very interesting, the made up stories often read
as a children's book. Nonetheless, this doesn't make the information in
this book any less valuable. The authors have lived it through and
through, and possess a very healthy and pragmatic vision on agile
software development.  

> Ultimately what matters is success, however you define it. The
> practices, principles, and values are merely guides along the way.
>  Start by following the practices rigorously. Learn what the the
> principles mean. Break the rules, experiment, see what works, and
> learn some more. Share your insights and passion, and learn even more.

I rate this book 4/5. You can [get it on
Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596527675/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596527675).
