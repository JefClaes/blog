[A Real Developer](http://arealdeveloper.com/) is a side-project I built
over the weekend poking around with
[WebMatrix](http://www.asp.net/webmatrix).

It got a little out of hand. After publishing, I showed it to a few
popular tweeps, and they were kind enough to mention it. 24 hours after
the launch it has gotten over 3.5k unique visitors, 39k page views (see
what I did there?) and over 240 submissions. Being mentioned by [Scott
Hanselman](http://twitter.com/#!/shanselman) and [Rey
Bango](http://twitter.com/#!/reybango) helps.  
  
I kind of felt like a mini - Mark Zuckerberg constantly refreshing the
page and reading new quotes hours afer the launch.  
  
I was somewhat surprised by how original and creative our community is.
Some of my favorite quotes so far..  
  
A real developer has changed live code in production at least once,
begrudgingly. (by
[@jasonfamularo](http://twitter.com/#!/jasonfamularo))  
A real developer has code on his t-shirt. (by
[@stevenmilne](http://twitter.com/#!/stevenmilne))  
A real developer knows family is more important than computers. (by
[@shanselman](http://twitter.com/#!/shanselman))  
A real developer tries to write as little code as possible. (by
[@marknijhof](http://twitter.com/#!/marknijhof))  
A real developer works in the dark, but communicates with those in the
light. (by [@atcrawford](http://twitter.com/#!/atcrawford))  
A real developer understands code is nearly the same as an organic
life-form that evolves. (by
[@stefandidak](http://twitter.com/#!/stefandidak))  
  
And so much more of them are awesome.  
  
**The future**  
  
I enjoyed the experience so far. I'm well aware that this buzz will end
soon, but I'm going to try to maintain momentum as long as possible.  
  
That's why I am eager to hear your suggestions and feedback.  
  
Requests received so far:

-   Make it possible to up- or downvote quotes.
-   Make a smart algorithm based on those votes.
-   Make it easier to link to quotes.
-   Twitter authentication.

I might open source this little project (it's only 50 lines of code) and
I might do a few blog posts on the making of in the next weeks.
