The girlfriend and I returned from our [West Coast
roadtrip](https://www.jefclaes.be/2011/08/west-coast-road-trip-schedule.html) yesterday morning.  
  
We found this trip to be an unforgettable experience, which made us even
more hungry for future travels.  
  
This blog will return to business as usual, with mainly technical
content and opinions.  
  
Here is an overview of our posts exploring the West Coast:
