After [Venice on
Wednesday](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/07/the-floating-city.html), we
decided to stay in Torbole for a relaxing hike yesterday. As it turned
out, the hiking trail that was described in the brochures as suitable
for all and with a duration of 1h20, in reality took us 2h30 and sour
calves to complete. The views of the lake's valley and its school of
windsurfers defying the wind were worth the sweat though. Arriving at
the endpoint, and discovering that we had to wait over an hour for the
bus to take us back, we stumbled upon one of the best hidden lake side
terraces we've seen yet.

Since the days of our dolce vita are numbered, we made our last big trip
today: [Milano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan). We parked our car
in the suburbs, where you pay only a quarter an hour and have a direct
metro-connection to the [Duomo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duomo).
While we've had it with churches in general, we couldn't let this one
slip. The Milanese Duomo is the third biggest church in all of
Christendom and could easily host a Metallica concert. The entrance to
the church is free, but if you want to visit the rooftop, you pay 7€ on
foot (250 stairs) or 12€ if you want to take the elevator. Although the
panorama wasn't as striking as the one we had seen yesterday, the
architecture and craftsmanship of the rooftop details are worth to see
up close. After that, we continued the 'Old City' itinerary of our
travel guide, which includes the [Galleria Vittorio Emanuele
II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_Vittorio_Emanuele_II) and the
[Teatro alla Scala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Scala).
