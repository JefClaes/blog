The next morning we woke up to another rainy day. We caught up with the
rain in Austria and we have been following it ever since. Or the other
way around. Even the locals can't seem to stop talking about how much
rain is falling.  
  
Between showers, we were able to hike the
[Vintgar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bled_Gorge) trail. The one hour
hike takes you along dangerous rapid waters, bringing you to a big
waterfall. If I ever wondered how J.R.R. Tolkien came up with
inspiration for his famous novels, now I have a good idea.

On Tuesday, exploring the [Postojna cave
system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postojna_Cave) by train and on foot
offered similar enchanting images.

After exchanging the Slovenian scenery for that of Croatia - still
raining - we visited the [Plitvice
Lakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plitvice_Lakes_National_Park) on
Thursday. The non-stop rain had caused a big part of the park to flood.
If you didn't mind getting wet up Â to your knees, wading through the
lakes that were now on top of the trails was definitely an option - one
that we took.

We'll spend our last few days in Croatia along the coastline, hoping to
at least warm up a little after our wet and cold experience in the
national park.
