This week I decided to buy a new PC, because my old one was randomly
rebooting, was really out-of-date and because I deserved it.  
  
My old PC had turned into a Frankenstein PC over the years, that's why I
decided to write a little summary of the modifications I did to it over
the years.

1.  My new PC only had a 40GB hard drive, which wasn't that big of a
    problem at first. I didn't have internet at the time! But once my
    parents got me a broadband internet connection, I was running out of
    space pretty fast. So I bought a new 200GB hard drive.
2.  After installing my new hard drive, I started monitoring my hard
    drive's health and came to the conclusion that the hard drives were
    producing too much heat, so I added the fans. I had to cut a piece
    out of my case, to give the fans some fresh air.
3.  After a year, it was time to add some RAM, so I added 256MB of RAM,
    which gave me a whooping 0.5GB of RAM!
4.  At the time I started playing Counterstrike 1.6 with my
    schoolbuddies and my VGA couldn't get a stable 100FPS when standing
    in a smoke grenade, so I bought a new VGA from a friend.
5.  Now that I added the extra RAM and a new VGA, my PC wasn't stable
    anymore when gaming, so I needed to add some fans. Fan number 5 was
    supposed to suck some fresh air into the case.
6.  And fan number 6 was there to keep the VGA cool(er).

  

I'm in love with my new PC . I'm not into hardware, so I asked a friend
of mine who works in the local PC store to make an offer.

  
He came up with a pretty awesome configuration for the price of €666
(number of the beast obv):  

1.  Motherboard: G112 GIGABYTE GA-MA770-DS3 AMD AM2+ ATX DDR2 1066 S/GBL
2.  CPU: AMD PHENOM AM2+ QUAD CORE X4 9850 2.5GHZ 4MB BOX
3.  RAM: 2x DDR2 APACER 2GB PC6400/800 LFT CL5.0
4.  VGA: G44 GIGABYTE GF 9600 GT 512MB GDDR3 PCI-E TV-O/DUAL DVI SP
5.  Harddrive: 500GB Sata

  

I now have my new PC for two days, and it is really awesome. I wasn't
used to be able to play cool games anymore and forgot how much fun they
can be. I installed GTR Evolutions (I'm a huge fan of race sims) and I
installed Far Cry 2. I'm able to play Farcry 2 at high quality and the
graphics and the gameplay are just amazing.

  
If there are other cools games I should play please let me know.
