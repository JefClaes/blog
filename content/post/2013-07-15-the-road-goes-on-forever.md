We didn’t get to see a lot of Salt Lake City. Before heading to Idaho
Falls, we hung around at the mall, feasted on Sushi, and bought new
hiking shoes since ours literally fell apart.  
Since Idaho Falls just served as a launching point to Yellowstone, we
filled the hole in our schedule with a date night; we had BBQ and went
to see [WorldWar Z](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z_(film)).

  

After another long drive the next day, we exchanged the dirt for greener
scenery. We drove through Grand Teton, to get to of one our last and
most anticipated destinations; [Yellowstone National
Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park). We spent
two days here, in which we drove across the extensive volcanic area,
stopping at all popular attractions (geysers, pools, waterfalls…),
spotting and stalking wildlife on the way. 

Instead of a motel, we slept in the wild - in bear country, in a Tipi.
Although our host armed us with bear spray, we got a good night’s sleep.
Today however, we did spot a baby Grizzly bear from afar!

  

Tomorrow will be our last day, which we will spend in Cody, Wyoming.
