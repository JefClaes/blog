Blame no one but yourself. This is one of the few quotes I remember
months after reading [this book](https://jefclaes.be/2011/04/its-not-how-good-you-are-its-how-good.html). Although it's a harsh statement, there definitely is some truth to it.  
  
Once I started observing my own behavior when faced with failure, I
caught myself regularly blaming others for failures to which I am - at
least - an accomplice.  
  
Think about it. You might be guilty of this too.  
  
Frustrated with management because you missed *their* too tight
deadline? Did you tell your project manager that taking that 'one small'
task in between would get you behind on schedule? Dissapointed by your
team mate because he messed up the task you asked him to do? Are you
sure you gave him all the information and provided enough feedback?
Tired of doing the same repetitive task over and over? Why haven't you
automated it yet? Not happy with a certain implementation? Did you speak
up and propose alternative solutions?  
  
So next time you blame someone else, ask yourself: Did I try everything
within my reach to make this work or did I unconsciously sabotage this
myself?
