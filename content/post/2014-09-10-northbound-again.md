[Leaving Plitvice behind
us](http://www.jefclaes.be/2014/09/tolkiens-inspiration.html), we
crossed the country heading for the sea. We didn't need to cover a lot
of distance, to discover how diverse the Croatian landscape and climate
is. In only two hours we went from the cold, foggy lakes and waterfalls
to green meadows to dusty mountains to sunbathing coasts.

We followed the coastline for a little while, strolling through old
coast towns, eating seafood, drinking something cold. Driving up North
and more inland, we spent two days in Motovun, a picturesque town high
on a mountain.

We'll be continuing up North, slowly making our way home.
