Today I have spent a few hours evaluating this year's analytics of my
blog. In total I posted 59 entries this year, but in this post you will
only find the 5 most popular, plus the ones that I liked writing a lot
but failed to make it to the top 5.  
  
**The most popular posts of 2010**  
  
1. [Cannot start Service from the command line or
debugger.](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/03/cannot-start-service-from-command-line.html):
The most popular post of 2010, almost all traffic was completely driven
by search engines. In this post I share a trick that makes it easier for
our team to debug Windows services. Next to the trick our team uses, I
also share some alternative (Microsoft) approaches to this issue.  
  
2. [Customizing Telerik RadGrid
tooltips](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/01/customizing-telerik-radgrid-tooltips.html):
Looks like a lot of people are not fond of the default RadGrid tooltips,
or they are searching for a way to localize the tooltips (which is not
supported). In this post I show how you can customize the RadGrid
tooltips and make the customization consistent through your
webapplication using ASP.NET Themes.  
  
3. [Listening for UDP packets in a Windows service using an
UdpClient](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/03/listening-for-udp-packets-in-windows.html):
In this post you can find how to use an UdpClient in a Windows service
to listen for UDP packets.  
  
4. [HTML5: The Geolocation API is scary
(good)](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/12/html5-geolocation-api-is-scary-good.html):
People definitely are curious for HTML5. Here I show an example of the
HTML5 Geolocation API. I also search for documentation on the internals
of the Geolocation API, but come home empty handed. I am still looking
for good resources! You can also find a demo where you can test how
accurate the Geolocation API is for your machine. Please let me know.  
  
5. [Switching with non-constant cases in
C\#](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/07/switching-with-non-constant-cases-in-c.html):
In this post I try to resolve Compiler Error CS0150 (A constant value is
expected). The first option uses else-if statements and the second
option uses a dictionary. The second option turns out to be the most
safe and elegant.  
  
**My favorite posts of 2010**  
  
1. Webforms lessons learned the hard way [Part
1](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/02/webforms-lessons-learned-hard-way-part.html)
and [Part
2](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/02/webforms-lessons-learned-hard-way-part_15.html):
In these two posts I look back on what I have learned about Webforms in
the past two years.  
  
2. [Webforms refactoring: Eliminating redundant eventhandlers using a
dictionary to map
controls](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/07/webforms-refactoring-eliminating.html):
Something I have seen way too often, redundant eventhandlers in
Webforms. In this post I use a few iterations to come up with a good
solution. You should also check out the
[follow-up](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/07/follow-up-eliminating-redundant.html).  
  
3. [Building a tagcloud with jQuery and ASMX
Webservices](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/09/building-tagcloud-with-jquery-and-asmx.html):
This post demonstrates how you can create your own tagcloud using jQuery
and good old ASMX Webservices.  
  
**Thank you so much for reading my posts this year! I will come to a
more in-depth personal review of 2010 in a future post.**
