The first time you open the [IE9 developer
tools](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/aa740478.aspx) a new window
opens.  
  
This isn't always desirable, think laptop/small monitor. That's why you
can dock/pin the tools in your browser. It took me a few minutes of
dragging and searching in menus before I found the way to do this. In
the upper right corner of the window you find an extra button *Pin*. You
can also use the shortcut CTRL + P.
