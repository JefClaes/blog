I just returned from a four day trip to Tunisia with [Euricom](http://www.euri.com/). Next to indulging on the sun, food and all-inclusive cocktails, getting to know each other in a less professional setting, we spent somewhere around half of our days - and this is a rather generous estimate - doing technical sessions and workshops.

I gave a 90 minute long crash course on REST and ASP.NET Web API.
