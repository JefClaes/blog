At [Euricom](http://euri.com/), we quarterly all retreat to headquarters
for a day of sharing and learning. This time, I and others organized and
facilitated an event storming workshop.  
  
After a short introduction on event storming participants were initiated
to the domain of [Cambio
CarSharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambio_CarSharing)Â - which is
packed with behaviour. After that, seven groups of five (+ one domain
expert) spread out across the office, and spent two slots of twenty
minutes modeling the domain - with two extra slots for feedback.  
  
Even after an afternoon of taxing sessions, people were willing to tap
out of their energy reserves, and ended up presenting great results.  
  
You can find the slides (heavily based on
[Alberto](https://twitter.com/ziobrando)'s material) I used
[here](http://www.slideshare.net/jclaes/workshop-event-storming), or
embedded below.  
  

  
  
If you're interested in running your first event storming workshop, I'd
love to come over and help you get started.
