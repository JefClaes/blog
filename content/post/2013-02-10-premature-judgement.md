When I started my first job, I hardly ever judged my peers. After all,
how could I? Everything was unknown for me; I couldn't differentiate
good from bad. Over the years that has changed a bit, but with that,
I've also slowly become more judgemental towards peers, often
prematurely, and not always deservedly.  
  
The first few months of last year, I found myself doing maintenance on a
legacy code base between projects. While I worked my way through layer
after layer, I pointed my frustration towards those that had come before
me; they were responsible for putting me in this mess. With half the
office having touched the code base, that didn't really add up though.
When I looked at the commit history of some of the offending modules, I
found names that I didn't expect; those people were still around, and I
actually thought of them pretty highly.  
  
Judging someone's competence solely by code he has written in the past
is a flaw. There are very little pieces of code I have written over the
years where I still feel comfortable about today. When I reflect on what
made it go wrong, I don't have to look far to find a bunch of reasons to
blame it on; consistency was favored over common sense, major
breakthroughs occurred only after the project was already in maintenance
mode, people inexperienced with the domain and infrastructure were
dumped on the project last minute to make up for bad planning, knowledge
of the technology stack hadn't matured, some patterns and practices
weren't commonplace yet, etc... I always find plenty of reasons to shift
blame, but when I look at code written by someone else, it has to be
their own fault; they must not be very good at building software. And
this is unfair; I have no way of knowing the constraints they had to
deal with, nor the context they had to work in. None of these justify
neglecting basic hygiene though!  
  
I tried to come up with other things that influence my opinion on
someone before having actually worked with them; I found two.  

1. The biggest influencer is word of mouth. I try to surround myself with people that share a similar thinking, and if that trusted circle has a strong opinion on someone else, I take note.
2. The last influencer is someone's online presence. When I learn of someone new joining ranks, I can't resist to look up what he's doing online. Twitter, Facebook or a blog can give away quite a bit.
   
All in all, I think some preconception is human, and might be the result
of subconsciously protecting your work. You only want to involve those
with whom you will enjoy working towards your shared goal.  

*Have you experienced similar behavior? When do you judge prematurely?*
