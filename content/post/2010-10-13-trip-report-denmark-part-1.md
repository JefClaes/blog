Last month me and [my
girlfriend](http://amillionimpressions.blogspot.com/) went on a holiday
to [Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) for a week. We had a
great time, visited a lot of places and took hundreds of pictures. In
this post you can find a trip report containing the best pictures and
tips on places to see.  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Copenhagen</span>  
  
The first three days of this holiday we visited
[Copenhagen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen). These three days
were the most interesting, but also the most intensive days of the
holiday. There are so many places to visit in Copenhagen!

If you are in Copenhagen to do some sightseeing I advice you to get
yourself a [Copenhagen
card](http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/tourist/what_to_see_and_do/copenhagen_card/where_to_buy_copenhagen_card).
This card is valid for 72 hours and includes entrance fees for almost
all attractions and public transport. And it only costs 63â‚¬.  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Ripley's believe it or not
museum</span>  
  
Next to the [TV
show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripley's_Believe_It_or_Not!#Television)
hosted by [Superman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Cain), there are
Ripley's believe it or not museums spread over the world. Although this
museum isn't a must-see, the bizarre items featured are definitely
entertaining.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Dansk Design Center</span>  
  
Although this is one of the museums my girlfriend had to drag me to, it
turned out to be not that bad. The UX people out there will find this
very interesting.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Christianborg</span>  
  
This palace used to be the home of the Danish monarchy. Today
[Christianborg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiansborg_Palace) is
the seat of the parliament, the Prime Minister's Office and the Supreme
Court.  
  
The palace is probably most known for it's turbulent past. It had to be
rebuilt two times due to serious fires.  
  
A small part of the palace is open to the public. The inside of the
palace is even more impressive than the outside!

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Tivoli</span>  
  
[Tivoli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoli) is the second oldest
amusement park in the world. It was built over 150 years ago. Although
you can't compare it to Disney World, this is a must-see. If you go
there, I advice you to go by night.  
  
[![](../images/thumbnails/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_118.JPG)](../images/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_118.JPG)

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Zoological Museum</span>  
  
In this museum there is a permanent exhibition called From Pole To Pole.
There is also a semi-permanent Darwin exhibition.  
  
[![](../images/thumbnails/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_159.JPG)](../images/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_159.JPG)

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Copenhagen Zoo</span>  
  
The [Copenhagen Zoo](http://uk.zoo.dk/VisitZoo.aspx) is definitely worth
a visit. The main reason we wanted to go there is because we wanted to
see a [Tasmanian Devil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Devil).
Copenhagen Zoo is the only zoo outside of Australia that has Tasmanian
Devils in captivity. It turned out it didn't totally live up to [our
expectation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Devil_(Looney_Tunes))

<span style="font-style:italic;">The Tasmanian Devil guarding its
territory borders. Not that scary right?</span>  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Christiania</span>  
  
[Christiania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown_Christiania) is a
special part of Copenhagen. This part of Copenhagen is a self-proclaimed
autonomous neighbourhood. In the seventies a group of hippies founded
this freetown. Although the government tried to turn the situation
around at first, in the late seventies Christiania was tolerated and
considered a social experiment.  
  
This probably was the weirdest experience of this trip. Soft drugs are
tolerated and publicly sold in Christiania, giving this freetown a very
special atmosphere. People from all around Copenhagen get together here
to smoke, socialize and <span style="font-style:italic;">chill</span>.  
  
Too bad taking pictures at Pusher Street isn't allowed.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Rosenborg castle</span>  
  
[This castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenborg_Castle) used to be
a country summerhouse for the monarchy. Today it is a museum exhibiting
the Royal Collection and Crown Jewels.  
  
[![](../images/thumbnails/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_345.JPG)](../images/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_345.JPG)

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Nyhavn</span>  
  
[Nyhaven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyhavn), meaning new harbor, is
very popular among tourists. It is best known for its colorful buildings
and cozy restaurants.  
  
[![](../images/thumbnails/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_378.JPG)](../images/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_378.JPG)  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Architecture</span>  
  
For people with an architectural fetish there are tons of buildings
worth visiting. The ones that impressed me the most are the [Black
Diamond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Danish_Library) and the [new
Opera House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Opera_House).  
  
[![](../images/thumbnails/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_403.JPG)](../images/2010-10-13-trip-report-denmark-part-1-Kopenhagen_403.JPG)
