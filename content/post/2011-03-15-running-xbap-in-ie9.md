By default you can't run [XAML Browser
Applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAML_Browser_Applications) in
IE9. You will get an "An error occurred in the application you were
running" error.

To run an XBAP in IE9 you need to add the hosting site to your trusted
sites..

.. or you could convert the application to Silverlight, or preferably
HTML5 ;)
