As [more established
bloggers](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html)
have argued before, there is something essentially wrong with job
interviews in our industry. Software companies hire developers without
even making them touch a keyboard. As long as you talk the walk you are
able to land yourself a decent position. There are [complete lists of
.NET interview
questions](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatGreatNETDevelopersOughtToKnowMoreNETInterviewQuestions.aspx)
out there, which should, with enough preparation, make it possible for a
somewhat technologiable person to ace the average .NET interview.  
  
To get an idea of the state of job interviews today, I asked
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/JefClaes) and the [Reddit
crowd](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/hog5l/have_you_ever_typed_code_on_a_job_interview_very/)
about their experiences.  
  
The questions asked were:

-   Have you ever typed code on a job interview?
-   If you did, how often?
-   Where are you from?

I used [this survey](http://www.tfaforms.com/206255) to gather the
responses.  
  
The survey has received 1360 answers so far.  
  
Out of those 1360 developers, only 45% has ever typed code on a job
interview.

To make things worse, of those 45%, only a small percentage had to do it
often.

I wonder, **if you were in a position to hire developers**, would you
make them code? Would you at least make them solve
[FizzBuzz](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html)?
If you are in a position to call the shots, why aren't you making us
type?  
  
Do you think there is a correlation between making interviewees type and
the programming language? Are small companies more likely to make you
type? **Are great companies more likely to make you type**?  
  
**More analytics**  
  
I also did the math per continent. Turns out there are differences, but
they are marginal and probably sample size related. The sample size for
Africa and Asia was the smallest.  
  
**Europe**
