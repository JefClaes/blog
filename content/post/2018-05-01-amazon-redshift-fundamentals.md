Late 2017, we set out to replace and upgrade our existing reporting and
analytics infrastructure with something that would be a better fit for
our workloads. Keeping costs and required maintenance at a minimum would
be a nice plus, making for an easy sell. After a bit of research, it was
obvious [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) had the
potential to tick all the right boxes. While steadily porting the most
problematic workloads away from our existing infrastructure, I started
writing an investigative article on the fundamental concepts of Amazon
Redshift. I learned a lot studying each individual building block,
allowing me to make some small, but impactful changes to our own setup
along the way.  

  

The outcome is a 10.000 word document (1 hour reading time), covering 7
topics:  

-   Storage
-   Distribution
-   Importing data
-   Table maintenance
-   Exporting data
-   Query processing
-   Workload management

  

The text is available in three formats:  

-   [HTML](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.jefclaes.be/amazon-redshift-fundamentals/aws-redshift-fundamentals.html)
-   [EPUB](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.jefclaes.be/amazon-redshift-fundamentals/aws-redshift-fundamentals.epub)
-   [MOBI](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.jefclaes.be/amazon-redshift-fundamentals/aws-redshift-fundamentals.mobi)
    (Kindle)

  

The project is open source and available [on
Github](https://github.com/JefClaes/amazon-redshift-fundamentals).

  

Thanks to everyone who proof-read earlier iterations and provided me
with indispensable feedback.

  

I hope this work can teach you as much as it thought me. I'm looking
forward to your feedback.
