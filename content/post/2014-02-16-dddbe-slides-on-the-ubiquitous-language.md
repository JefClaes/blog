Monday, I and four others did a [DDDBE](http://domaindriven.be/) session on the strategic side of Domain Driven Design.  

My talk covered the Ubiquitous Language, and can be found [on Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/jclaes/the-ubiquitous-language). I might end up writing down the content of the talk as well - some images are meaningless without words.Â 

Evaluating feedback, I think the biggest mistake we made was keeping some things too abstract - curse of knowledge at work. If we get the chance to repeat the session, we need to make sure to weave a practical
story through our talks to make them stick.
