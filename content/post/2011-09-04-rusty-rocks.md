We started the day with a short drive to [Zion National
Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_National_Park). On our way we
came across some colossal rock formations, layered with different shades
of red. Since the park is almost entirely car free, we took the shuttle
bus along the scenic route. We got off at different stops, to take short
hikes to the park's natural treasures. The Emerald Pools were first up,
followed by the Weeping Rock and a riverside walk to the Narrows, which
are architected by the [Virgin
river](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_River). Wading in the river
gave us some much needed refreshment after a long day of hiking.
