Starting 2014, I wanted to look more closely at everything I consume. So
I started keeping a list of everything I read, watch and listen to.  
  
I started off with a markdown file on Github that quikcly evolved into a
good excuse to dabble with an alternative stack. I ended up writing an
event sourced node.js application on top of postgres, hosted on Heroku.
I could write a post on that particular experience, but it's safe to say
[this blog post](http://notes.ericjiang.com/posts/751) captures it
better than I ever could.  
  
In 2014, I listened to 10 audiobooks and 18 podcasts, read 20 books and
watched 12 movies and 13 shows.  
  
I just went over the list and cherry picked three items per category
that stuck with me the most.  
  
**Books**  

1.  [Addiction by
    Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691160880/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0691160880&linkCode=as2&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkId=VOHHIGAAZRBYS4CW):
    An incredibly complete overview of the gambling industry, with
    insights into the human psyche which apply far outside the domain of
    gambling. 
2.  [11/22/63](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451627297/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1451627297&linkCode=as2&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkId=PWN25BXIZGUYENQL):
    I try to read a fiction book for every non-fiction book I read. This
    was my first "real" King book, and I was hooked instantly. I
    devoured the 880 pages thick book in less than two weeks, and was
    left with a big gaping hole in my heart - the journey was more than
    worth it. 
3.  [SQL Performance
    Explained](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3950307826/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=3950307826&linkCode=as2&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkId=PLZSBRRPM2O3LYTA):
    The author succeeds in capturing the essentials in only 204 pages.
    This is one of those books you want to have going around at the
    office. 

**Movies**

1.  [Be Here To Love
    Me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423853/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1):
    Not-your-average documentary about Townes van Zandt; my musical and
    philosophical discovery of 2014. A troubled soul, struggling with
    the futility of existence. Simple poetic songs beautifully crafted,
    capturing in a few words what would take others books. While
    darkness inspired his best work, it was also the search for relief
    of that same darkness that led him further down the path of
    self-destructive behaviour. Painful to
    watch. [Rake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPxz_4wIa4g), [Waiting
    around to die](http://youtu.be/kFh4DebJAfs?t=1m30s), [Snake Mountain
    Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V825I5waU3g), [Dollar Bill
    Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaqKdl_T3ak).
2.  [3-10 to
    Yuma](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381849/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1): A true
    modern Western, capturing the American West beautifully, [making me
    nostalgic](http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/once-upon-time-in-west.html).
3.  [Dallas Buyers
    Club](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790636/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1): Is
    there one role Matthew McConaughey can't hack?

**Audio books**

1.  [On Writing - A Memoir of the
    Craft](http://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/On-Writing-Audiobook/B002V1A0WE/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1420974710&sr=1-1):
    "What follows is an attempt to put down, briefly and simply, how I
    came to the craft (of telling stories on paper), what I know about
    it now, and how it's done. It's about the day job; it's about the
    language." If you're not a King fan, you will be after finishing
    this one. 
2.  [Getting to
    Yes](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Getting-to-Yes-Audiobook/B004X1T8G4/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1420974726&sr=1-1):
    Separate people and issues, focus on interest, generate options and
    use objective criteria. But also, what to do when the other party is
    more powerful or when they use dirty tricks.
3.  [Blink](http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/Blink-Audiobook/B002VAEK3K/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1420974744&sr=1-1):
    Making decisions in the blink of an eye; why you should go with
    instinct and why you shouldn't.

**Shows**

1.  [True
    Detective](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1):
    "Life's barely long enough to get good at one thing. So be careful
    what you get good at." "If the only thing keeping a person decent is
    the expectation of divine reward then, brother, that person is a
    piece of shit." "People incapable of guilt usually do have a good
    time." Heavy stuff.
2.  [Rick and
    Morty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1):
    "Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call love
    is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed." "Nobody
    exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody's gonna die.
    Come watch TV? "Snuffles was my slave name, you can call me snowball
    because my fur is white and pretty." Must be the best animated
    series of the moment hands down, looking forward to next season. The
    first season is [available for
    free](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmPIe8rQUYlI7bQp2ONfxvg).
3.  [The Walking
    Dead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1):
    Addictive soap opera that features zombies.
