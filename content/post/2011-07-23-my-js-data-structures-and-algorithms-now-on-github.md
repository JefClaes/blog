If you have been reading my blog lately, you know that I'm implementing
some data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. So far, I have
blogged about [simple sorting algorithms](https://jefclaes.be/2011/07/simple-sorting-in-javascript.html), [the stack data structure and the queue data structure](https://jefclaes.be/2011/07/stacks-and-queues-in-javascript.html). This week I have also implemented a doubly linked list. I started writing a post about that last implementation, but I didn't like where it was going, so instead of writing about it, I have pushed everything to a public Git repository.  
  
You can [find the public repository here](https://github.com/JefClaes/Data-structures-and-algorithms-in-JavaScript).  
  
I structured the repository like this:
- `Scripts`: The JavaScript files which contain the various algorithms and data structures.
- `Implementations`: HTML pages used to demonstrate the usage of some of these algorithms and data structures.
- `Tests`: QUnit tests.

Feel free to watch or fork this project. I will still be writing about
most implemenations, but probably not all of them.
