Yesterday evening we spent the night in a town called
[Tonopah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonopah,_Nevada), which is
literally in the middle of nowhere. Today we continued our trip to
[Zion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_National_Park) (Utah), driving
hundreds of miles through the Nevada desert, getting sunburned on the
way. There was not a soul in sight, except for cattle crossing the road,
who seemed to be waiting for us to pass to say hello. 

  

We just arrived at [St.
George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George,_Utah), which is a
launching point to Zion National Park.

  

So, not much to report today. Anyway, here are a few random pictures of
our drive through the Nevada desert.
