I have picked up a few new tools this summer
([MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [NancyFx](http://nancyfx.org/) and
[WebAPI](http://www.asp.net/web-api)), and it occurred to me that I've
built certain habits these last few years in how I make use of all the
learning resources out there.  
I tried to identify all of them, to then categorize them, to finally
order them according to in which phase of my study process I use them.  
  
**The written and spoken word**  
  
The first thing I look for online is documentation. It might be a
coincidence, but all the documentation I found for these three tools was
excellent. It seems obvious, now more than ever, that the early
adaptation of new tools can be proportional to the quality of their
documentation.  
  
When there is no documentation - studying a concept instead of a
technology, when the documentation is too dispersed, or when the quality
is too low, I might order a book. The problem with technical books
though, is that they are often too lengthy. I think the first publisher
that cuts down on the number of pages, while guarding quality, will be
pleasantly surprised by demand. I really like [the "Little book"
format](http://openmymind.net/2011/3/28/The-Little-MongoDB-Book/) [Karl
Seguin](http://openmymind.net/) has been experimenting with.  
  
When there is no documentation, and there are no books, I find myself
turning to the spoken word. In general, I prefer reading over watching
and listening because I can do that at my own pace, skip chapters, or
quickly skim back for a look-up.  
Although often on the slow side, the videocasts from Pluralsight are not
bad. If you don't want to subscribe to one of the paid videocast
services, you can also watch recorded conference sessions instead.
Before I commuted by train, I also listened to relevant podcasts.  
  
**Getting intimate**  
  
As I wrote earlier, [I am a strong advocate of learning by
doing](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/03/learning-hacker-way.html). Find
[something
small](http://www.jefclaes.be/2011/09/building-small-things.html), and
build it.  
When I'm using a new tool, I also tend to regularly peek at its
internals to improve my understanding of how the tool works under the
covers. It's never a bad idea to get intimate with the tools you rely
on.  
This becomes extremely easy when the tool you are using is OSS and uses
a source control provider that makes it easy to browse or fork the
source - read GitHub. If the tool isn't OSS, you can still decompile the
sources using one of the free decompilation options out there. If you
have a Resharper 6 license, you can even decompile straight from Visual
Studio.  
  
**Sipping from the fire hose**  
  
Once I start building something, I crank open the fire hose - Twitter
Search, and take a sip. Although trying to consume all the information
on a subject is hardly bearable, and feels as being waterboarded at
times, I think it's a necessary evil. Until you have assembled your
personal digest, that is.  
  
I'll do my best to keep up with the Twitter Search feed for a while, and
try to filter knowledgeable people to follow, blogs to subscribe to, and
repositories to watch. Once I have a qualitative list of subscriptions,
I'll shut off the fire hose, and limit my consummation to my personal
high quality-to-noise digest. This digest will serve as one of the
biggest aids in continuously improving my knowledge of said tool.  
  
**Free pop quizzes**  
  
I always thought that if you really want to become good at something -
become an expert, you must have spent time in the trenches, knees deep
in shit. Experiences like this force you to broaden your understanding
of a technology.  
Next to problems you encounter producing things, you can also simulate
this experience by following [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
questions and commit to help solving them. The less ambitious can also
wait a while, and just skim over the questions and their answers. The
same goes for mailing lists obviously.  
  
  
*I'm very curious to hear about the techniques you use to unravel all
the information out there.Â *
