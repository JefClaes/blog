[Last
year](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/04/trip-report-czech-republic.html)
my girlfriend and I already made a trip to the Czech Republic, but we
felt like we had spent to little time visiting Prague. We made up for
that by making a follow-up trip last week.  
  
Find some of our most memorable impressions captured on picture
