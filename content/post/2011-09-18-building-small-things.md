Due to the nature of things we build in our day to day job, writing
software can wear out even the most fit of us.  
  
Most software jobs make you constantly deal with complexity. The amount
of things which can lead to a complex software project are immense. A
poor first design, and failure to redesign. External dependencies, which
seem to behave different every time around. Or just the complexity of
the problems itself.  
You are almost always working in a team, which can be exhausting as
well. If the team doesn't share your passion and you have a hard time
getting your ideas across, you will get frustrated, real soon. Add some
coroporate politics to the mix and you'll be on your way to Paranoia.  
  
It feels like I'm turning this into a rant, but I'll stop right here,
you get where I'm going at. Building software in the real world can be
hard. Very hard.  
  
I like to think building something small on your own once in a while can
be extremely liberating. It can help you keep your sanity and not lose
your passion towards software. You pick what to build. Something small.
Something new. Something built with your favorite tools, on your
favorite platform. Something that can be shipped. Something which takes
only you and your machine.  
  
Having problems finding something meaningful to make? Look around you,
the most trivial problem can lead to a satisfying little sideproject.
Look for things that bother you, and try making them bother you less.
Listen to others, maybe you can help solve their problems. Who cares if
it already exists in one way or the other? Look for something that looks
fun. And just build it.
