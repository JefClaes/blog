I was lucky to pick up a copy of [More Joel on
Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430209879/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217153&creative=399353&creativeASIN=1430209879) for only 5 euros at a [bookfest](http://www.boekenfestijn.com/) last week. Turns out the book ships pretty cheap on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430209879/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217153&creative=399353&creativeASIN=1430209879) as well.  
  
More Joel on Software was written by [Joel Spolsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky), already a legend for launching [The Stack Exchange Network](http://stackexchange.com/) with [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/). Although it's hard to not know him, I admittedly hadn't read a lot of his material so far. Starting my professional career in late 2008, the Spolsky writing high days were mostly over.  
  
More Joel on Software is the second
[blook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blook) which bundles the best of
the digital content of the [Joel on Software
blog](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) into a dead tree. Although you can
find every part of the book on [Spolsky's
blog](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/), it was well worth the money. I
love how he has, next to amusing anecdotes, a very opinionated view on
our industry which really challenges you to broaden your thinking. His
writing is also extremely enjoyable, I think he must be one of the best
writers in our field.  
  
Here is, for your convenience, the content of the book with links to the
original articles online. Might be useful if you are the owner of one of
those [reading devices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle).
