I rarely review books with non-technical content here, but I just felt
like I had to with this one.  
  
The book [Got
Fight?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061721727?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0061721727)
was written by [Forrest
Griffin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Griffin), assisted by
Erich Krauss.  
  
Forrest Griffin is one of the toughest light-heavyweight mixed martial
artists competing in the [UFC](http://uk.ufc.com/). If you are
unfamiliar with MMA and UFC, I encourage you to [watch one of the
Forrest Griffin tribute
videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsUW3x3GSWE) on Youtube.

This book touches several subjects. Forrest talks about the path he
followed to become a professional fighter and what made him who he is
today. Forrest also shares a bunch of advice on fighting and
non-fighting topics. The last part of the book contains a series of
how-to MMA techniques. All these topics are talked together in the form
of **hilarious**, and sometimes offending (to some of you), ramblings.
After all, the main goal to read this book shouldn't be to learn, but to
be entertained, and *maybe* learn something along the way!  
  
Below you can find some quotes taken from the book, which will probably
tell you a lot more than my small summary above.  
  
**Forrest on..**  
  
.. sphincter control  

> Back in the day, when I first met a chick, there was no way I would
> let one rip. I would wait until at least the second or third date
> before I introduced her to my Love Potion 109.

  
.. advice for the fat and tremendously out-of-shape fighter  

> Steroids, steroids, steroids. This magic elixir can replace all forms
> of training and will add to your intimidating appearance.

  
.. cheating  

> When asked about the tactic after the fight, Tito said, 'If you ain't
> cheating, you ain't trying'. I would have to agree with him. I would
> rather be known as a cheater than a loser. Seriously, I have this deep
> hatred of losing.

  
.. fear  

> A black eye will dissapear and a broken nose can be mended. Fear is a
> good thing because it keeps you alive, but it becomes so great that it
> hinders you from doing what you want, you need to confront it head-on.

  
.. eating challenges  

> I kept mumbling over and over, 'Oh God, I made a mistake', and
> vociferously promised sweet baby Jesus I would never accept an eating
> challenge again.

  
.. being humble  

> Although it can be depressing to admit to yourself that you will never
> be the best, it is liberating at the same time. Instead of trying to
> be better than everyone else, which is existentially arrogant, you can
> focus on being the best that you can be.

  
**My rating: 4/5**. This is probably the funniest book I have ever
read.
