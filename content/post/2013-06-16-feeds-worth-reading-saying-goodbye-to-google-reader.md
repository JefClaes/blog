New to programming in the wild, and starving for hints on how to do it
better, I would often stumble upon programmers documenting their journey
on a personal blog. A big orange icon would incite readers to subscribe
to their content using RSS. Taking the bait, I started using Google
Reader, and found myself frantically hoarding feeds a bit later.  
  
After a while I got fed up with going through an abundance of
subscriptions daily though; it was turning into a chore. Instead of
forsaking RSS, I set myself to aggressively cut down the number of feeds
I subscribe to - [RSS is too powerful to just
dismiss](http://www.jefclaes.be/2012/05/why-i-will-always-love-rss.html).
A feed I subscribe to should be fairly consistent at making what I read
worthwhile. I even adapted the practice of putting a feed in quarantine
before it makes it into my permanent reading list.  
  
Being a loyal Reader user for five years, I was startled when [Google
announced the end of
Reader](http://googleblog.blogspot.be/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html).
Although I somewhat understand Google feels the need to focus on a
limited set of products, condemning Reader to the graveyard must hurt
the trust of an influential customer segment; tech-savvy people. I for
one feel less and less confident hosting my writings on Blogger, and I
will definitely think twice before I take a dependency on another Google
service in the future. I take comfort in the thought that Google is less
likely to kill a service where they have been trusted with content that
lies very close to a customer's heart, and that when they do close the
books, they have a reputation of making your way out as smooth as
possible.  
  
Now that July is creeping up on us, I have to get off the fence, and
elect a Google Reader successor. When I asked the Twitter crowd where
they migrated to, [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/) seemed to be the
consensus. I had a look at its homepage, but not offering a browser
based version is a showstopper for me. I then read [this Lifehacker
article](http://lifehacker.com/5990881/five-best-google-reader-alternatives),
and decided on trying [The Old Reader](http://theoldreader.com/), which
doesn't seem to move my Google Reader cheese too much.  
  
Preparing the migration, I took five minutes to push my OPML file, and a
more readable markdown representation to Github.
