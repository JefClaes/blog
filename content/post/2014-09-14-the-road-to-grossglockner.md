Sixteen days after leaving home, we're now on our way back to Antwerp.
After Croatia, we've driven through Slovenia, Italy, Austra and
Switzerland, arriving in France to meet up with my parents for a few
days.  
  
France offered us the typical vineyards and chateaux. What, next to the
good company, will stick with me the most is the High Alpine road in
Austria. We paid 34 euros to be allowed on the road, but the
surroundings of that piece of asphalt are extraordinary.  
The drive is rough, maybe even more so coming down than going up. No
wonder car manufacturers use it to test drive their close to
production-ready prototypes.  
  
It has been quite the trip. I had never expected to give my eyes such a
show so close to home.
