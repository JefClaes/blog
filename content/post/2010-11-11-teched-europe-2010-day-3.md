In this post you can find information on the sessions I attended at
[TechEd Europe](http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/) today. I will
give a very brief summary per session accompanied by some interesting
links you can use to find more information on the subject.  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">ASP.NET MVC for WebForms
developers</span>  
  
[Dino Esposito](http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/) started his session by
comparing ASP.NET MVC to ASP.NET WebForms. Once that was out of the way,
he showed how both technologies, having the same functionalities and
using the same core, are different in their implementation.  
  
This [MSDN
article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd942833.aspx) shows a
detailed comparison of these two technologies. If you are (relatively)
new to ASP.NET MVC, like me, you can start learning more by visiting the
[project portal](http://www.asp.net/mvc).  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Deep dive into HTML5</span>  
  
To get our full attention [Giorgio
Sardo](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/giorgio/) started his session by
showcasing two amazing HTML5 implementations already out there in the
wild:

-   [JoyDefinesTheFuture.com](http://joydefinesthefuture.com/)
-   [Agent8Ball.com](http://agent8ball.com/)

Once he had our attention, he started demoing the technical stuff:

-   [Canvas](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-canvas-element.html)
-   [Video](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html)
-   [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)
-   [CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-roadmap/)
-   Extensions to javascript

If you can't wait to start playing with HTML5, you can find support for
HTML5 Visual Studio Intellisense at [the Visual Studio
Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d771cbc8-d60a-40b0-a1d8-f19fc393127d).  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">What's new in ASP.NET MVC 3 and
Razor</span>  
  
In this session [Jonathan Carter](http://lostintangent.com/) showed us
what's new in ASP.NET MVC 3.  
  
He focused on the 4 most important improvements:

-   Package management with [NUGet](http://nuget.codeplex.com/)
-   Simplified view development with new Helpers and
    [Razor](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx)
-   Improved testability with dependency resolution
-   [Global
    filters](http://weblogs.asp.net/gunnarpeipman/archive/2010/08/15/asp-net-mvc-3-global-action-filters.aspx)

You can find more information on what's new in ASP.NET MVC 3
[here](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/27/introducing-asp-net-mvc-3-preview-1.aspx).  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Design considerations for ASP.NET MVC
applications</span>  
  
The last session of the day was probably the most intensive one. [Dino
Esposito](http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/) took us on a deep dive into
some important ASP.NET MVC best practices:

-   [Strongly typed
    views](http://www.howmvcworks.net/OnViews/BuildingAStronglyTypedView)
-   [Fat free
    controllers](http://blog.falkayn.com/2009/02/fat-controller-must-die.html)
-   [SRP (Single responsibility
    principle)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)

  
  
<span style="font-style:italic;">I plan on posting the most interesting
stuff here daily this week, so stay tuned! </span>
