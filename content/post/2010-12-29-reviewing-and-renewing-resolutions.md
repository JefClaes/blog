### My career  
  
I'm still working on the same projects as I was last year: Firestation
Antwerp and Ghent. This year we did not build a lot of brand new things,
but we have added a decent amount of new functionalities. Next to that
there were a bunch of bugs to fix and technical debt to pay off. I
learned a lot from the mistakes we made and refactoring makes you really
think about what good and clean code should look like.  
  
In 2011 I will still be spending time on Firestation Antwerp and Ghent.
There is a hazy bright light on the horizon though, chances are there is
a new interesting challenge ahead.  
  
This year I had some fun side-challenges. I gave internal technical
sessions on ASP.NET 4 & ASP.NET AJAX, something I enjoyed doing more than I thought. I also passed the MCTS 70-536 exam, which I didn't enjoy studying for that much. In 2011 I want to pass at least one MCTS ASP.NET exam, and give more technical sessions.  
  
### Blog
  
I have written 62 posts this year. Not as much as I would have liked to. There are several reasons I didn't produce more content. I have had a technology hiatus this summer, because I was just too busy with other life stuff. Next to that, I have been working on a side-project and have been studying for the MCTS 70-356 exam. A lot of excuses, but I plan to make up for it in 2011.

I am pretty satisfied with the qualtiy I produced this year, although
there is a lot of room for improvement. I like to think a good metric
for quality is the number of visitors and retweets. I got double the
traffic compared to last year, which makes me feel a little warm
inside.

This year I mainly blogged about Webforms (refactoring), ASP.NET AJAX,
the Bing API, TechEd, IE9 and HTML5. In 2011 I plan to continue to focus
on Microsoft and the web. I'm still an MVC and WebMatrix novice, which
needs to change next year.  
  
### Community  
  
Last year I planned on being more active on StackOverflow, but I failed
miserably. I don't think I will be making this a goal this year. I'm
just going to continue to go there for questions only.  
  
I also planned on going to a big event in 2010, which turned out to be
TechEd Europe. Seriously, I could hang around there an entire month.  
  
In being part of the Belgian .NET community I was less successful. I
have been talking a lot with other Belgian developers through blogs and
Twitter, but I should attend more real-life events. With the
DrinksWithDevs community [Davy Brion](http://davybrion.com/blog/) is
starting, I think I might be doing better this year.  
  
### Travelling  
  
One of the goals I'm totally satisfied about.  
  
Next to citytripping in Belgium, I was lucky enough to travel abroad 5
times this year:
-   [Czech Republic](https://jefclaes.be/2010/04/trip-report-czech-republic.html)
-   [Holland](https://jefclaes.be/2010/07/tripping-in-holland-honey-who-shrunk.html)
-   [Denmark](https://jefclaes.be/2010/10/trip-report-denmark-part-2.html)
-   Spain
-   Germany (TechEd)

There are no plans for next year (yet), but I don't think I will be able
to do much better.  
  
### Sport/Health
  
This is a new section in this year's report. Sport has become more and
more important to me over the years. Next to going to the gym and
running, I picked up boxing this September.  
  
In the next year I want to focus more on conditioning and less on
strength. It's hard to set a specific goal right now, because I haven't
measured the speed and distance of my runs this year. For Christmas I
got the [Nike+ iPod gear](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FEK400?ie=UTF8&tag=diofanedebyje-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002FEK400), so that should help me to collect some data the following months.  
  
### Conclusion
  
This year had its ups and downs. Not a lot of exciting things happened
at work, but 2011 should change that. I am overall content with the
progress of my blog, although I think I should do better next year. I
should be very satisfied with the travelling I did this year, I have
spent more than a month abroad! I think I improved my health noticeably
this year, I hope I stay injury-free and can put enough effort in to
keep on improving my conditioning.  
  
All by all 2010 was a good year and I hope 2011 will be at least as
good. And to be honest, I don't mind not being able to accomplish all
goals, because the love of my family and friends compensates a lot. That
was cheesy, right?
