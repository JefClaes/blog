This is a decision that often needs to be made by middle management. For
managers the most natural way to make this call is by evaluating the
[return on
investment](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment). To
calculate the ROI, you need to compare the gain of an investment
relative to the amount of investment. And this is exactly where things
get hard, if not impossible. Measuring developer productivity is one of
the unsolvable problems in our industry.  
  
If a developer wants something which he feels will improve his
productivity, not a lot of questions should be asked. The investment is
probably ridiculously little, compared to the risk of depressing one of
your codemonkeys. Developer happinness is at least as important as
developer productivity. Happy developers tend to get passionate about
their profession, and therefor ship better software as a result. And
that's what we are all after, right?

I also find that peers saying something along the lines of "What's wrong
with notepad?" are foolish. If you are most productive and happy using
notepad, that's perfectly fine, but don't go belittling people who enjoy
using more rich and intelligent editors. Your ePenis is probably large
enough as it is.
