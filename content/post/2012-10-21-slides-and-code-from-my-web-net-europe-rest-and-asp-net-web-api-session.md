I just returned to the hotel after attending and speaking at [Web.NET
Europe 2012](http://webnetconf.eu/). There were multiple sessions on
ASP.NET Web API today, and I was responsible for delivering the first
one of the day. Being first, and to avoid overlap with others, I tried
to lay a solid foundation by focusing on the REST and ASP.NET Web API
basics: resources, identifiers, representations, verbs and hypermedia.  
  
More people than I expected showed up for my talk; somewhere around 50
to 70 attendees, I guess. I think it was fairly well received; after 25
votes, the session rating stands at 90%. It's great to see your
preparations have such a fruitful outcome.  
  
I still have a few thoughts on the conference to materialize, but for
now, I uploaded [the
slides](http://www.slideshare.net/jclaes/rest-and-aspnet-web-api-milan)
(they're also embedded below) and hosted the [source code on
GitHub](https://github.com/JefClaes/aspnet-webapi-samples-webdotnet).
