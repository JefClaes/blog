For those who haven't heard of [ELMAH](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/)
yet, here is the project description.  

> ELMAH (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) is an application-wide
> error logging facility that is completely pluggable. It can be
> dynamically added to a running ASP.NET web application, or even all
> ASP.NET web applications on a machine, without any need for
> re-compilation or re-deployment.

While ELMAH is completely **not** [AppHarbor](https://appharbor.com/)
specific, there do seem to be a [fair
amount](http://feedback.appharbor.com/forums/95687-general/suggestions/1423059-add-support-for-elmah)
of
[questions](http://support.appharbor.com/discussions/problems/541-getting-elmah-to-work)
on [the AppHarbor support
forums](http://support.appharbor.com/discussions/problems/18-permissions-for-elmahaxd)
on how to get ELMAH running. I just installed and configured ELMAH for
one of my AppHarbor ASP.NET MVC3 applications, so I thought it would be
nice to share and give something back to the AppHarbor support guys.  
  
I think enabling ELMAH shouldn't take more than 10 minutes if you follow
this tutorial.  
  
**Installation**  
  
The easiest way to add ELMAH to your web application is by installing
[the nuget package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/elmah).  

    PM> Install-Package elmah
    Attempting to resolve dependency 'elmah.corelibrary (= 1.2)'.
    Successfully installed 'elmah 1.2.0.1'.
    Successfully added 'elmah 1.2.0.1' to Docary.

Once this is done you will find a newly added Elmah reference and a
changed web.config.  
  
I'm not going to list all the changes to the web.config here. If you're
interested in what the package does to your web.config, you should just
run a [git
diff](http://book.git-scm.com/3_comparing_commits_-_git_diff.html).  
  
**Error log storage**  
  
You have to tell ELMAH where it should store the logs. A list of error
logÂ implementations can be found [on the project
wiki](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/ErrorLogImplementations).  
  
I choose to use the in-memory error log *for now*. Add the elmah section
and errorLog element to your web.config.  

    <elmah>    
        <errorLog type="Elmah.MemoryErrorLog, Elmah" size="250" />
    </elmah>

**Remote access**  
  
By default you can only see the logging on the local machine. To enable
remote access, you have to add the security element to the elmah
section.  

    <elmah>
        <security allowRemoteAccess="1" />
        <errorLog type="Elmah.MemoryErrorLog, Elmah" size="250" />
    </elmah>

**Security**  
  
Now that you're allowing remote access, you want to [secure the logging
page](http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/01/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google.html).
I used ASP.NET authorization to achieve this.  
  
Add the following element to your web.config, and make sure you change
the authorization configuration to the **relevant values**.  

    <location path="elmah.axd">
        <system.web>
          <httpHandlers>
            <add verb="POST,GET,HEAD" path="elmah.axd" type="Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, Elmah" />
          </httpHandlers>
          <authorization>
            <allow roles="SuperUser"/>
            <deny users="*" />
          </authorization>
        </system.web>
        <system.webServer>
          <handlers>
            <add name="ELMAH" verb="POST,GET,HEAD" path="elmah.axd" type="Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, Elmah" preCondition="integratedMode" />
          </handlers>
        </system.webServer>
    </location>

**Finished**  

**  
**

Push these changes, and you should be done. Navigate to elmah.axd in the
root of your web application and you should see something like this.

It should be easier now to start playing with [more advanced ELMAH
options](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki).
