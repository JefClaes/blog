Hanging around in the pub after DDDX, I ended up talking to [Alberto
Brandolini](https://twitter.com/ziobrando). For those who have never met
him; he's very much into visualization. You will always see him carrying
a drawing pad, with a dash of permanent marker on his cheek, and a few
lost sticky notes on his back. I don't know if it was the Italian accent
and the strong gestures, or my mildly intoxicated condition, but the
idea of visualization as an important tool grew on me even more that
evening.  
  
During the conversation Alberto shared a recent experience where he was
brought in as a facilitator to assist in planning multiple projects
spread over a bunch of teams spanning multiple months. The bottom line
was that with a big wall of paper, some hand drawn boxes, and lots of
sticky notes, they had enabled intense and efficient collaboration,
achieving what upper management had expected to take weeks, in a single
day.  
  
In my current project, we also could have taken advantage of these
tools. Early on in the project, a team member was charged with the task
of documenting all existing payment file transfers in the company. This
isn't as trivial as it sounds though; these files come in through a
handful of specialized secure gateways, are then transferred internally
by a few different propriety transfer platforms - of which some still
stem from the mainframe era, to be processed, and returned to the
customer through one of the gateways in one of the available output
formats. To make matters worse, all of these systems are owned by
different teams.  
We probably tackled this in the worst way possible; with a spreadsheet
and meetings. We could have tried occupying a meeting room, plastering
the wall with paper; drawing all the systems on, and inviting all
involved teams to come in and help us visualize all the transfers
between systems. We could draw arrows between the systems, and stick
post-it notes on top that represent a file with its constraints (source
and destination folders, schedules etc...).  
Too late for that now, but I'm curious to set out such an experiment in
the future.  
  
As you're reading this, I'm traveling for three weeks - which I'll
surely write about, and in my backpack are two books that should help
keep me occupied during the flight, and long overlays: [Visual
Meetings](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470601787/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470601787&linkCode=as2&tag=diofanedebyje-20),
and [The Back of the
Napkin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842697/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591842697&linkCode=as2&tag=diofanedebyje-20).
I'm confident there's a lot of value to be found in visualization,
either to make sense of a complex problem, or as a tool to support
collaboration. Going forward I plan to get a lot better at it.
