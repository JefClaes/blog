Only a few weeks ago, we got an annual
[Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/)
subscription at [Euricom](http://www.euri.com/). Since then, I have
downloaded a couple of videos, raw wmv's, to watch offline on my laptop,
commuting.  
  
Yesterday, being out of material, I headed over to the Pluralsight
website to download some more content. I discovered the site was
redesigned, removing download links next to the videos.  
  
Heading over to [their blog](http://blog.pluralsight.com/), I found out
more.  
  
On 24 October, they
[announced](http://blog.pluralsight.com/2011/10/24/offline-viewing-what-happened-to-the-downloads-tab/)
the site redesign, obsoleting the download links and focusing on support
for mobile devices.  

> However, this change does require you to have a supported mobile
> device to take advantage of offline viewing moving forward. We no
> longer support offline viewing on laptops/desktops, at least for now. 

Just *one* day later, after receiving - probably a shitload of -
negative feedback, they
[promised](http://blog.pluralsight.com/2011/10/25/offline-viewing-for-laptopsdesktops/)
to support offline support for laptops and desktops in the near future
again. 

> We’ve listened to your feedback and have decided to support offline
> viewing for laptop/desktop users. We’re going to implement a desktop
> app that will provide offline viewing as soon as possible. We’re going
> to work around the clock to get this desktop app ready for release as
> soon as possible and hope to have the initial beta out within a few
> weeks from now.

After reading the initial post, I was somewhat dissatisfied as a
customer. I knew the decision had to make sense though, from a business
perspective. Supporting less platforms means less code, which is good.
And mobile is big, it *feels* big anyway.  
  
Based on the time it took to make the second announcement, I'm pretty
sure mobile is nowhere near big enough to forget about laptops and
desktops. Hey, being able to have a desktop on my lap still feels mobile
enough to me.  
  
I'm satisfied again though. I'm content Pluralsight didn't pull a 'Steve
Jobs', and just pushed through their vision. Or maybe, they just can't
afford to make a small (?) percentage of customers unhappy.  
  
Some **other random thoughts**: Pluralsight, is it hard to include the
links back in the website for now? Or is all the old infrastructure
gone? What were other (business?) motivations to completely get rid of
raw videos? Pirates, aay?
