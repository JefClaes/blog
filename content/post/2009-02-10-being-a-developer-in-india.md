Nowadays all you here is: hey let's outsource our call center, our IT
department, our developer team.. to India. I asked [Mudassar Ahmed
Khan](http://mudassarkhan.wordpress.com/) a few questions about how it's
like being a developer in India.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How is it like to be a developer in
India?</span>  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">  
</span>Quite bad..  

1.  You get into heavy competition from day one when you join a Computer
    Science course.
2.  Companies set percentage criteria for young graduates. If you are
    below those criteria you will have a hard time finding a job.
3.  If you get into the company, the company decides what you will work
    on.
4.  For Multinationals you need to pay security amount which is refunded
    when you complete a certain period in the company the period has a
    range 1-4 years depending on the company.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you make up for the lack of
experience? Work harder, be more passionate, ...?</span>  
  
In Multinationals you can't be more passionate because you have a lot of
restrictions. But you get a fair amount of money too. In Midsized and
smaller companies, you'll get good work but at the cost of less money.
But here too you can't be passionate since the Team Leaders and Project
Managers mostly don't allow you to do so. So it's the company which
decides much rather than the individual. It's very rare that you get
into a company that allows you to use ideas like mine.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is the general feeling about
outsourcing? Is everyone just content that it is great for the economy,
or do people have doubts?</span>  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">  
</span>It has increased the IT in India and many companies take up
outsourced work from other countries. Recently the recession affected
many companies and they have removed many employees. So it has both
positive and negative effects.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Do you think India is a threat to
Europe? </span>  
  
I have no idea in that perspective.
