Yesterday, we drove from Saint-George to Page, Arizona. The [Pipe
Springs National
Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Spring_National_Monument)
happened to be on our way, so we made a stop. Turned out there wasn't
much to see. A 30-minute ranger-led tour made it worthwhile though.
During the tour through the Winsor Castle, she told us about the Mormons
who used to live there. The Fort manager, also head of their Mormon
church, married 58 women, resulting in plenty of children to work the
Fort.

  

Arriving at Page, we hiked the Horseshoe Bend trail, which ended in one
of the most amazing views we've seen so far. To cool off, we took a swim
in [Lake Powell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_powell), the
reservoir above the [Glen Canyon
Dam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Canyon_Dam).

Today we took a guided tour through [Antelope
Canyon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antelope_Canyon), which resulted in
some interesting pictures.

At the moment we're in Flagstaff, which will be our launching point to
the Grand Canyon tomorrow.
