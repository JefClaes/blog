This Sunday, my girlfriend and I are leaving for a three-week roadtrip
along the West Coast.  
  
During these three weeks, we plan on writing about our experiences and
publishing them on this blog. We see this as a way to capture memories
and report to the homefront in the meantime. I hope the regular readers
who come here for technical content, won't be dissapointed.  
  
Usually our holidays are well (or over) prepared. This time we took
another approach, we already fixed our route and booked our hotels, but
we haven't determined yet what to go see at each location.  
  
For most locations, we wrote down some points of interests though. I
know a lot of people who visit this blog are American, so <span
style="font-weight:bold;">I'm hoping you can add to those or disfavor
some of them.</span>  
  
So far, our schedule looks like this.  
  
**San Francisco (3 days)**

-   Pier 39
-   Alcatrez Island
-   Lombard Street
-   Golden Gate Bridge
-   China Town

**Yosemite National Park and Mono Lake (2 days)**

-   Valley Visitor Center
-   Yosemite Falls

**Zion National Park (1 day)**
