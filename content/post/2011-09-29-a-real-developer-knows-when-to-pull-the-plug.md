My mini-website [arealdeveloper.com](http://arealdeveloper.com/) will no
longer be available online after tomorrow.  
  
I slapped it together over a weekend, trying out WebMatrix, which turned
out to be the [perfect
companion](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-thoughts-on-webmatrix.html)
for [building small
things](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2011/09/building-small-things.html).  
  
A pleasant surprise was [the mention of 'A Real Developer' by the guys
at
Channel9](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2011/05/arealdevelopercom-mentioned-on-channel9.html).
This made the traffic go through the roof for a few days.  
  
A few months later the site was a ghosttown. But I don't mind, I even
predicted this. It never had the ambition to deliver real value. I was
more than happy to deliver five minutes of entertainment.

To have a memento, I [uploaded the source to
GitHub](https://github.com/JefClaes/ARealDeveloper). Remember, it's far
from clever or impressive. However, I do think it can serve as a nice
introduction-by-example to WebMatrix.  
  
I committed the latest database as well, so now you can read all the
quotes (even the bad ones), and start your own t-shirt business ;).
