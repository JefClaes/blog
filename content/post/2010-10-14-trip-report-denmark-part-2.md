<span style="font-weight:bold;">Funen</span>  
  
After three days of Copenhagen we stayed at
[Funen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funen) for two days. This is the
smallest of the three big islands of Denmark. Our motel was in a small
town called Faaborg.  
  
During these two days in Funen the most impressive attraction we went to
see was the [Egeskov
Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egeskov_Castle). This castle is
Europe's best preserved Renaissance water castle. You can also walk
around in the big park surrounding the castle, or visit the five museums
on the Egeskov domain. The vintage automobile and motorcycle museums are
awesome!

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Jutland</span>  
  
The last three days of our trip we stayed at the biggest island
(peninsula) of Denmark,
[Jutland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutland).  
  
Here we visited the [oldest city of
Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribe), went hiking and strolled
the cleanest beaches in Europe. A perfect place to relax and find new
energy.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span>  
  
This trip was amazing. From Copenhagen to Jutland, this country has
surprised me hundreds of times. We got the best out of Denmark's culture
and history in Copenhagen, and enjoyed the beauty of Denmark's nature in
Funen and Jutland. Summarized Denmark has it all!  
  
One small drawback is that Denmark isn't cheap. Everything is twice as
expensive compared to Belgium. Although with some good looking around
you can save a lot.  
  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">And you?</span>  
  
Have you ever been to Denmark? Is it on your wishlist?
