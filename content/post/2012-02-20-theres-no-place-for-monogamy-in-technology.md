In this post I would like to share some of my thoughts on a [recent post
by James Hague](http://prog21.dadgum.com/128.html) titled 'Don't Fall in
Love With Your Technology'. If you haven't read that post yet, please
do, it's so short that me summarizing it here would be silly.  
  
I think there is nothing wrong with falling in love with your technology
per se. If you want to have a fair relationship with your technology,
you have to invest in her. Don't have a superficial relationship, take
her home with you, spend some cosy Sunday afternoons together. Get to
know her inside out. Know when it's fun to be with her, but also more
importantly when it's not.  
  
The problem with falling in love with your technology is that a lot of
us fall blindly in love. Please don't. Be unfaithful, do - at least -
look at other technologies. Take them out on a crazy Friday night date.
In the meanwhile you might discover that that new technology does a few
things better than the current one and that she's a lot more fun.  
  
I guarantee that what now seems like the love of your life, will one day
be nothing more than a long forgotten memory which might bring a smirk
on your face on remembering her, but there will be no regret in leaving
her.
