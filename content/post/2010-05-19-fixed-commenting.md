After giving my blog a [new
design](http://jclaes.blogspot.com/2010/05/blog-redesign.html) a
[few](http://twitter.com/sassyboy) people pointed out that posting a
comment was broken. You had to tab your way to the submit button.  
  
Turns out that the comment section is hosted in an iFrame and that
scrolling was disabled.  
  
That issue should be solved now. Please let me know if commenting isn't
working for you!
