I have had a fair amount of discussions on continuous learning and
knowledge sharing the past few days. It became rather obvious that a lot
of us have developed their own techniques, but also that maybe most of
us are still in search of more efficient techniques. Having gone through
several phases myself, I would like to share my current way of learning:
the Hacker Way.  
  
Here are some snippets taken from a [recent
letter](http://seo-hacker.com/hacker/) from Mark Zuckerberg addressed to
the Facebook shareholders.

I like to believe learning should be a hands-on activity as well.
Basically, stop consuming, start producing. Don't get me wrong, I do
think there is value in reading blog posts (I might be slightly biased
on this one), reading books and watching videos, but I find that this
value is marginal compared to what you gain by actually doing it.  
  
I remember I wanted to step up my JavaScript game two years ago, and
[ordered a
book](http://www.jefclaes.be/2010/02/book-review-object-oriented-javascript.html).
A few months after finishing the book, I finally had the chance to
implement something in JavaScript, but I couldn't. I remembered some
syntax, and most concepts, but I couldn't do it. Eventually I really
learned JavaScript by doing it on the job, having to constantly fall
back on the book and Stackoverflow, making costly mistakes along the
way.  
  
It's not a terrible idea to pick up a new technology on the job, but it
very much depends on the environment. If you're in the consultancy
business, there often is no room to pick up a brand new technology on
the job. Customers expect you to know what you're doing.  
Imagine you really want to get into mobile development, and you were
able to get in the race for a new mobile project. Getting interviewed by
the customer, you have to admit that you haven't built something for
mobile yet, but you did read a book and you find mobile development
really interesting. It's really hard to sell that. If you are able to
show something you made, and talk about things that work and things that
don't work in the real world, the customer can get a far better feel if
you would be a good fit for the project.

This is where it becomes interesting and where you can really make the
difference as a company.  
  
Depending on various parameters, you often don't have the room to
experiment on the day job, but if you're building something by yourself
or in a small team without these constraints, you can [get
wild](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QckCBwdeCJU): experiment, innovate
and fail often. Not only do you build experience faster, but you also
(maybe indirectly) challenge existing practices and build a deeper
understanding of the used methodologies and technologies. Also, having
the freedom to innovate, aspiring to get closer to the Silver Bullet,
can bring yourself, the company and the industry to the next level.  
  
This is just the first step of the cycle though. The next step should be
to get these little projects and acquired experiences out there. Share
them with your peers and the community, educate those who want to listen
and ask for feedback from those who care, hopefully fueling the
inspiration of others.  
  
A welcome side-effect might be that the results could be used to extend
your personal and your company's portfolio. This can help you prove that
you can do more than just talk the walk, talk is cheap after all.  
  
*I want to know from you what the flaws are in my way of thinking. Is
the described technique naive, too idealistic or unrealistic? Which technique has proven to work best for you?*
