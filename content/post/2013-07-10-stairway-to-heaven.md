These last two days have been rather tiring. Yesterday we drove up to
[Bryce
Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Canyon_National_Park), where
we did the Queen’s Garden and Navajo Loop hike, which was only 3 miles
(5km) but was rather strenuous because the trail takes you all the way
down and all the way up again.

Today we followed the advice of the kind lady at the visitor center and
hiked along Calfs Creek. It was a 6 miles (10km) round trip through
loose sand in over 100°F (38°C), but halfway you’re rewarded with a
stunningly beautiful waterfall and a refreshing dip in the basin.
Driving up there, we got to witness the grandeur of the Utah plateau.
When we finally got back to the air conditioned car, we made a detour to
see the [Grand Staircase – Escalante National
Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Staircase-Escalante_National_Monument).
