October 18th [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) released [five new
sections](http://blog.linkedin.com/2010/10/18/linkedin-profile-sections/)
that can be [added to your
profile](http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1284). The
most important for us developers might be the Certifications section.
Although your peers aren't easily impressed by a certification, future
partners and employers **might** be.
